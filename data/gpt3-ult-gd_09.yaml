- en: Before the release of GPT-3, most people’s interaction with AI was limited to
    certain specific tasks, like asking Alexa to play your favorite song or using
    Google Translate to converse in different languages. Researchers have successfully
    developed AIs capable of performing mundane tasks, but so far, AIs have yet to
    match humans’ creative potential in performing abstract tasks without clear, well-defined
    instructions.

- en: 'Welinder summarizes OpenAI’s mission in three key points: “Develop AGI (artificial
    general intelligence), make sure it''s safe, and then lastly deploy it into the
    world to make it maximize the benefit to all of humanity.” Thus the company is

    AI。
- en: Hoping to achieve AGI as quickly and safely as possible, one of the technologies
    on which OpenAI decided to gamble was large language models, specifically GPT-3\.
    Welinder says of trying GPT-3, “That was the first time where we had something
    that we felt like, ‘Actually, this seems to be fairly useful, it's getting state-of-the-art
    results on a number of tasks in academic benchmarks and so on.’”

- en: 'Excited at the possibilities, Welinder and four colleagues debated how best
    to use the algorithm: Building a translation engine? A writing assistant? A customer-service
    application? Then it hit them. Welinder says:  “Why not instead just provide this
    technology as an API and let any developers build their own business on top of
    it?”'

    API，让任何开发者在其基础上构建自己的业务呢？”
- en: 'The API approach aligned with OpenAI’s goals and mission by maximizing the
    technology’s adoption and impact, empowering community members to invent applications
    that the OpenAI team could not have predicted. This also leaves product development

    OpenAI 团队可以专注于他们真正擅长的事情：开发强大、开创性的模型。
- en: Up to this point, the researchers had focused on designing scalable, efficient
    training systems to squeeze maximum efficiency out of the GPUs. But there had
    been little focus on actually running these models on actual data and getting
    something out of them for real-world applications. So the OpenAI team decided
    to double down on the core API experience, focusing on aspects like fast inference
    and low latency.

  zh: 到这一点，研究人员一直致力于设计可扩展、高效的训练系统，以最大程度地提高 GPU 的效率。但实际上在实际数据上运行这些模型并为现实应用获取实际结果的关注却很少。因此，OpenAI
    团队决定加倍核心 API 体验，专注于快速推理和低延迟等方面。
- en: 'Six months before they planned to launch the beta version of the API, they
    had, according to Welinder, reduced latency to around ten times and increased
    throughput by hundreds of times: “We spent a ton of engineering to really take
    these models, make sure that their GPUs are as efficient as possible, make calls
    to them with really low latency, and make it scalable.” Using the model via API
    instead of needing your own GPUs makes it cost-effective and accessible for ordinary
    developers to play with use cases and try new things. Very low latency is important
    as well, to make it easy to iterate. “You don''t want to put something in and
    then wait for minutes to get the response back, which was the case in the very
    earliest days of the API. And now you can see the model output stuff in real-time,”
    Welinder says.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在计划推出 API beta 版本的六个月前，他们根据韦林德的说法，将延迟降低到约十倍，吞吐量提高了数百倍：“我们花了大量的工程技术来确保这些模型，使它们的
    GPU 尽可能高效，以及以极低的延迟调用它们，并且使其具有可扩展性。”通过 API 使用模型而不需要自己的 GPU 使其具有成本效益，并且普通开发人员可以玩转应用案例并尝试新事物。非常低的延迟也很重要，以便轻松迭代。“你不想输入东西，然后等几分钟才能收到响应，这在
    API 最早期确实是这样的情况。现在你可以实时看到模型输出的东西，”韦林德说。
- en: OpenAI believed that the models would grow, making it difficult for developers
    to deploy them; the team wanted to remove this barrier. “It's just going to cost
    you too much because you need so many GPUs and CPUs to play with a use case. It's
    not going to make economic sense for you to deploy this model by yourself,” Welinder
    says. Instead, the company decided to share the model with developers via the
    API. “Thousands of developers are using the same models, and that's the way you
    can reach economies of scale,” Welinder adds. “And that lowers the prices for
    everybody to access these models and further widens the distribution, so more
    people can try out these models.”

  zh: OpenAI 认为这些模型将会增长，这会使开发人员难以部署它们；团队希望消除这一障碍。“这只会使您花费太多，因为您需要大量的 GPU 和 CPU 来玩转一个用例。如果您自己部署这个模型，这将毫无经济意义，”韦林德说。相反，公司决定通过
    API 与开发人员分享模型。“成千上万的开发人员正在使用相同的模型，这是您可以实现规模经济的方式，”韦林德补充说。“这降低了每个人访问这些模型的价格并进一步扩大了分发，因此更多的人可以尝试这些模型。”
- en: Releasing the OpenAI API in a private beta brought quite a few surprises. Their
    previous marquee model, GPT-2, had brought very few real-world use cases to life,

  zh: 在私人 beta 版本发布 OpenAI API 带来了许多惊喜。他们之前的标志性模型 GPT-2 让很少实现真实世界用例，因此团队希望 GPT-3 会更有用。确实，很快就实现了。
- en: 'Another surprise, Welinder says, was that “a lot of people on our platform
    weren''t programmers. They were authors, creatives of various kinds, they were
    designers and product managers, and so on.” GPT-3 in a way, changed what it means
    to be a developer: suddenly, it turns out that to build an AI application, you
    don’t need to know how to program. You just need to be good at describing what
    you want the AI to do using prompts (as discussed in Chapter 2).'

  zh: 韦林德表示，另一个惊喜是，“我们平台上许多人并不是程序员。他们是各种作者、创意人士、设计师和产品经理等。” GPT-3 在某种程度上改变了成为开发人员意味着什么：突然间，结果表明要构建一个
    AI 应用程序，并不需要知道如何编程。你只需要擅长使用提示描述你希望 AI 执行的任务（如第 2 章所讨论）。
- en: 'Welinder and his team found that  “oftentimes people that were really good
    at it had no machine learning background”-- and those who did had to unlearn how
    they thought about a lot of problems to use GPT-3\. Many users built GPT-3-based
    applications without code. The OpenAI team had, without really intending to, lowered
    the barriers to creating applications: a first step towards democratizing AI.
    “The core strategy is to make API usable for as many people as possible, Welinder
    says: "It''s core to our mission to make sure that the barrier to use our technology
    is low. That''s why we built this API.” Another unexpected use case of GPT-3 has
    been coding. Early signs of the model’s coding potential led OpenAI to double
    down on designing for coding use cases. Their efforts resulted in Codex, released

    Welinder说：“确保我们技术的使用门槛低是我们使命的核心。这就是为什么我们构建了这个API。” GPT-3的另一个意想不到的用例是编码。模型编码潜力的早期迹象促使OpenAI加倍努力设计编码用例。他们的努力导致了Codex的发布，于2021年年中发布。
- en: 'Along with a stunning variety of use cases, the API gave birth to a whole new
    ecosystem of startups: “Within a few months of launching the API, there were several
    companies that were being built entirely on top of the OpenAI API. Many of them
    have now raised VC funding at fairly high valuations,” Welinder says.'

- en: One of OpenAI’s core principles is working closely with customers. Welinder
    says, "Whenever we have new product features, we try to find customers that we
    know would find those features useful, and we create direct communication channels
    where we give them early access.” For example,  they worked with several customers

- en: Open AI is primarily concerned with ensuring the safe and responsible use of
    AI. In addition to the many positive outcomes, they see growing potential for
    misuse as AI becomes more accessible to the general public. One of the main reasons
    they chose to launch the API in private beta was to understand how people would
    use the models and check their potential for abuse. They examine as many instances
    of undesirable model behavior as possible, using what they learn to inform their

    In his view, because GPT-3 is robust and operates in the difficult-to-quantify
    domain of natural language, evaluating the quality of its output is complex and
    cumbersome. As exciting as a breakthrough can be, he says, “users are going to
    probably judge you on your worst-case performance, at best on your average performance.”
    Quickchat, therefore, optimizes user satisfaction. It was crucial for them to
    design a metric to capture variables correlated with happy users and high retention,
    both of which directly translate to higher revenue.

  zh: 另一个重要的教训是制定可靠的性能指标。“每当你在构建一个机器学习产品时，总是很棘手去评估，”Grudzień说。在他看来，因为GPT-3稳健并且运作在难以量化的自然语言领域，评估其输出质量是复杂且繁琐的。正如突破性的一刻可能会令人兴奋一样，他说，“用户最好会根据你的最差情况表现来评判你，或者至少会根据你的平均性能来评判。”因此，Quickchat优化了用户满意度。对于他们来说，设计一个能捕捉与快乐用户和高持续率相关的变量的指标至关重要，这两者直接转化为更高的收入。
- en: Another challenge, perhaps surprisingly, is GPT’s knack for creativity. “Even
    if you set a temperature very low, whatever prompt you give it, it's still going
    to use that prompt that is tiny and then generates something based on this vast
    knowledge that it has,” Grudzień explains. This makes it easy to generate creative
    text such as poetry, marketing copy, or fantasy stories. But most chatbots are
    for solving customer problems. “It needs to have predictable, repetitive performance,
    while still being conversational and to some extent creative, but not pushing
    it too far.”

  zh: 另一个挑战，也许令人意外的是，GPT对创造力的嗅觉。“即使你把温度设得很低，无论你给它什么提示，它依然会使用那微小的提示然后基于它拥有的广泛知识生成一些东西，”
    Grudzień解释道。这使得它容易生成诗歌、营销文案或幻想故事等创意文本。但大多数聊天机器人都是用来解决客户问题的。“它需要具有可预测的、重复的性能，同时还需要有对话性和到某种程度上的创造性，但不要过分推动。”
- en: Large language models sometimes output text that’s  “weird,” “empty,” or just
    “not that great,” so humans do need to intervene. “If you start measuring whether
    it managed to satisfy some condition or fulfill the task, then it's going to turn
    out that it's really creative, but out of 10 tries, it only succeeded six times—which
    is as good as zero when it comes to real business with paying customers.” Therefore,
    for a successful business application, you need a lot of internal systems and
    models that restrain that creativity and bolster reliability. “To create this
    tool for our customers that works 99% of the time, we developed a number of defense
    mechanisms,” Grudzień says.

    Grudzień说。

    Wang’s words, “That's where everything began. We started talking to users and

    like BERT and RoBERTa, require a significant level of fine-tuning for every downstream
    task. “It is extremely flexible in terms of the tasks it can perform,” she adds,
    and “it is the most powerful model out there.” What’s more, GPT-3 is “super-friendly
    for developers and users, with its simple text-in text-out interface that allows

    此外，GPT-3 对开发人员和用户非常友好，其简单的文本输入-文本输出接口使您能够使用简单的 API 执行各种任务。相对于托管专有模型所需的努力来说，它的另一个优势在于

    ask a computer to do anything?’” He began exploring, “poking at the corners of
    the OpenAI API and seeing how far it could go.” He came up with a bot that generates
    Instagram poetry; tried a self-podcasting journaling project in which users would
    speak to digital versions of themselves; worked on a music playlist-building project
    on Spotify based on users’ preferences; and created many more projects in service

    Adams 的搜索始于这样一个想法：“如果我可以让计算机做任何事情，我会做什么？”他开始探索，“探索 OpenAI API 的边缘，并看看它能走多远。” 他想出了一个生成
    Instagram 诗歌的机器人；尝试了一个自我播客的日记项目，用户会与自己的数字版本交谈；根据用户的偏好在 Spotify 上制作音乐播放列表的项目；并为了满足他的好奇心而创建了许多其他项目。多亏了这种好奇心，“我很早就擅长了解

    of well-written code, most GitHub users just download published code and use it:
    “No one''s really gonna admire the beauty that you put into your codebase.” He
    also noticed that great programs on GitHub that aren’t well documented often don’t
    get the visibility they deserve: “The readme [file] is the first thing that everybody
    sees. They immediately scroll down to it.” Stenography was an attempt to think
    about how documentation could evolve to become less annoying for developers: “It''s
    hard because, with documentation in particular, you have to justify what you did.

- en: So how does Stenography work, and how do its components leverage the OpenAI
    API? At a high level, Adams says, there are two main processes, parsing, and explanation,
    and each requires a different strategy. “For the parsing process, I spent a lot
    of time understanding the complexity of code because not all lines in your code
    are even worth documenting.” Some code might have an obvious purpose, have no

    一些代码可能有明显的目的，没有运行价值，或者已经不再有用。
- en: Additionally, “big” code blocks, reaching over 800 lines, are too tricky for
    the model to understand in one go. “You'd have to break down that logic to many
    different kinds of steps to be able to say accurately that this is what this thing
    does. Once I understood that I started thinking, ‘How can I leverage parsing to
    find blocks that are sufficiently complex, but not too complex?’”  Since everyone
    writes code differently, it's a matter of trying to attach to the abstract syntax
    tree and work with the best of what you have. That became the main architectural
    challenge of the parsing layer.

  zh: 此外，大型的代码块，超过 800 行，对于模型来说太复杂了。“你需要将这种逻辑分解为多种不同的步骤，才能准确地说出这个东西是做什么的。一旦我理解到这一点，我开始思考，‘我如何利用解析来找到足够复杂但不太复杂的代码块？’”
    由于每个人编写代码的方式都不同，所以尝试连接到抽象语法树，并与你所拥有的最好的东西一起工作。这成为了解析层的主要架构挑战。
- en: 'As for the explanation layer, “that''s more of a feature of getting GPT-3 and
    Codex to say what you want them to say,” Adams explains. The way to go about it
    is to find creative ways to understand your code’s audience and get GPT-3 to speak
    to it. This layer “can attempt to solve any question, but it might not solve it
    at a hundred percent accuracy like you would get with something like a calculator.
    If you type two plus two equals four, occasionally you get five, but you don''t
    need to write all the functions for multiplication, division, and subtraction.
    Those come for free.” That’s the trade-off with probabilistic systems: sometimes
    they work and sometimes they don''t, but they always return an answer. Adams advises
    remaining fluid enough to be able to pivot your strategy if necessary.'

    这就是概率系统的权衡：有时它们有效，有时它们无效，但它们总是返回一个答案。亚当斯建议保持足够的灵活性，以便在必要时改变你的策略。

  zh: 投资者通常在做出投资决策时会深入了解创始人的背景和专业知识。然而，GPT-3是不同寻常的，因为它允许来自任何背景的人，而不仅仅是程序员，来构建最前沿的自然语言处理产品。弗洛门伯格强调了市场的重要性：“通常情况下，对于深科技初创公司，我们会寻找具有出色技术和人工智能领域理解的创始人。但对于基于GPT-3的初创公司，我们更关注市场是否与创始人的愿景产生共鸣，以及他们是否能够识别和解决最终用户的需求”。他以Copy.AI为例，“这是一个基于GPT-3构建的产品导向增长模型的典型例子。他们与用户找到了非凡的共鸣，并对技术有了深入的了解，为市场带来了深度和价值。”成功的初创公司，他说，“将人工智能融入其中”，更专注于通过使用合适的工具解决用户的问题和满足他们的需求。
