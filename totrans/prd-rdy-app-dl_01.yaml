- en: AI projects begin with planning and understanding the difficulty of the given
    problem. Once the scope of the project is clearly defined, the next step is to
    create a **Minimum Viable Product** (**MVP**). For a project based on **deep learning**,
    this process involves preparing a set of data and exploring various model architectures
    to come up with a working solution to the problem. In this first part of the book,
    we explain how you can carry out the aforementioned steps efficiently by exploiting
    the various resources available.
