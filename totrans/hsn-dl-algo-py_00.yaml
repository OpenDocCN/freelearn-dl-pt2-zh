- en: Deep learning is one of the most popular domains in the **artificial intelligence**
    (**AI**) space, which allows you to develop multi-layered models of varying complexities.
    This book introduces you to popular deep learning algorithms—from basic to advanced—and
    shows you how to implement them from scratch using TensorFlow. Throughout the
    book, you’ll gain insights into each algorithm, the mathematical principles behind
    it, and how to implement them in the best possible manner.

- en: The book starts by explaining how you can build your own neural network, followed
    by introducing you to TensorFlow; the powerful Python-based library for machine
    learning and deep learning. Next, you will get up to speed with gradient descent
    variants, such as NAG, AMSGrad, AdaDelta, Adam, Nadam, and more. The book will
    then provide you with insights into the working of **Recurrent Neural Networks**
    (**RNNs**) and **Long Short-Term Memory** (**LSTM**) and how to generate song
    lyrics with RNN. Next, you will master the math for convolutional and Capsule
    networks, widely used for image recognition tasks. Towards the concluding chapters,
    you will learn how machines understand the semantics of words and documents using
    CBOW, skip-gram, and PV-DM. Then you will explore various GANs such as InfoGAN
    and LSGAN and also autoencoders such as contractive autoencoders, VAE, and so
    on.
