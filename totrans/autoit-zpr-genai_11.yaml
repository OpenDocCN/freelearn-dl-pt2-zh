    Multi-Step Zaps and Using Built-In Apps*, the power of Zapier lies in the functionality
    that you can take advantage of by using Zapier’s built-in apps. In this chapter,
    we will introduce you to built-in apps that extract data from emails, use RSS
    feeds, and create data digests. We will describe their functionality and provide
    practical tips on how to use them.

    Apps*, we covered built-in communication apps. So, in this chapter, we start with
    a similar theme by discussing how to extract data from emails using Email Parser
    by Zapier. Then, we will explore how to use RSS feed readers in automations using
    RSS by Zapier. After that, we will dive into how to compile data digests with
    Digest by Zapier. Finally, we will work through an exercise to build a Zap using
    RSS by Zapier and Digest by Zapier.

    want to receive a summary of at one time rather than as they happen. If you don’t
    want to be disturbed on certain days with regular notifications, turn them off
    and just receive a summary at times you specify. Conversely, some of your apps
    may not send you notifications of certain events, and in this case, you might
    want reports of certain occurrences at a regular time. You can also search for
    existing digest data to use in your workflows.

- en: The **Find Digest** search action event is handy to use when you want to periodically
    retrieve all the existing data in a digest. For example, you might want to check
    the digest for data every day (using a Schedule by Zapier trigger) and send an
    email notification with the results. You could also add a subsequent step to release
    the data, after passing a filter with certain conditions, such as if it was the
    15th day of the month.
