- en: Once you have got to grips with the inner workings of Zapier and you have created
    several Zaps, you will want to know whether your automations are running smoothly
    in the background as you conduct your daily business. You will also want to know
    straight away when problems occur, such as when your connected apps are experiencing
    downtime, there are errors with your Zaps, or changes occur in your Zapier account.
    Thankfully, Zapier has created two built-in apps that will help you keep on top
    of these situations. In general, when using the trigger events from these built-in
    apps, you can use various action steps as alerts, such as sending an email, SMS,
    or Slack message, or adding a task or activity to your task management app or
    CRM.

- en: In this chapter, we will discuss the two built-in apps that can be used for
    managing your Zapier account. We will start by covering App Status by Zapier to
    get notifications of integration issues. Then, we will review Zapier Manager for
    managing issues and changes in your Zapier account. Finally, we will cover some
    use cases.

- en: This chapter will be most useful for those users who are responsible for administrating
    systems within the business and where there is a critical need to keep an eye
    on system maintenance. This is especially important when multiple users in a team
    are creating automations, specifically in Team and Company plan accounts, and
    monitoring the administrative aspect of Zapier accounts using automations is beneficial.
    It is worth mentioning, however, that even single-user account owners will benefit
    from some alert notification Zaps being created, such as those related to errors
    and task usage.

    You can search for a Zap or public app, as well as turn Zaps on or off. If you

    Zapier team or notify you of new team members being added.

    or off when a specific trigger event occurs. Turning a Zap off, for example, might
    be useful in combination with one of the error trigger events, such as **New Zap
    Error**. You might want to turn the Zap off and then create a task in your project
    management tool to tell your team to assess the issue. Once this task has been
    completed, you can turn the Zap back on again.

    Zapier Manager to manage your Zapier account.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As mentioned earlier in this chapter, having automations set up to manage various
    aspects of your Zapier account is most suited to situations when multiple users
    are accessing Zapier on Team and Company accounts and many processes are being
    automated. System administrators will want to keep a handle on what is happening
    in the account to monitor task usage and errors, as well as automatically take
    action based on certain criteria.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common scenarios would involve creating alerts with your favorite notification
    tools, such as email or Slack, that trigger on any of the trigger events in either
    App Status by Zapier or Zapier Manager. Zap errors, halted tasks, and Zaps being
    turned off, as well as app status alerts, would be the most common for maintenance
    purposes. However, if you’re in a team, knowing when another team member creates
    a new folder or, more specifically, a new Zap, would be useful. You can then action
    other steps, such as adding information to a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

- en: For example, it would be handy to turn high-task-usage Zaps off using the **Turn
    Zap On/Off** action when you reach 90% of your task limit. You would use the **Task
    Usage Limit Reached** trigger to start the workflow and select a specific high-usage
    Zap to turn off. You could then restart the workflow when your task usage refreshes
    the next month, being triggered by the **New** **Invoice** trigger.
