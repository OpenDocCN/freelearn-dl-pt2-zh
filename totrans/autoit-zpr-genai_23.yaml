    by using **Generative Artificial Intelligence** (**AI**), integrating **AI** functionality
    into their software applications has become a priority for many SaaS companies.
    Zapier is no different. With the release of ChatGPT to the wider market and the
    possibility of integrating and incorporating AI functionality, Zapier is also
    in the process of releasing many AI-integrated features and has specified this
    as a key business objective for the near future. Several AI SaaS companies are
    also using the opportunity to integrate their apps with Zapier, making the combination
    of AI and automation a productivity booster.

    AI and automation. We will explore some of Zapier’s built-in AI functionality
    as well as AI app integrations with Zapier. First, we will cover how to get early
    access to new Zapier features that have incorporated AI functionality, then we
    will dive into an overview of the **Create a Zap** feature as used in the dashboard
    and the Zap editor. Then, we will explore NLA and AI actions functionality in
    the **Zapier Chrome extension** and **ChatGPT plugin**. After that, we will cover
    how to create **AI chatbots** with **Zapier Interfaces**. We will then cover a
    few new built-in apps and features such as **AI-powered Formatter by Zapier steps**,
    **AI-powered Code by Zapier steps**, **AI-powered troubleshooting**, **AI by Zapier
    built-in app**, and more. Finally, we will explore the **ChatGPT** and **OpenAI**
    integrations with Zapier, and the basics of GPT AI prompting.

    release it to a larger audience in a staged release to user groups. In other words,
    even though a feature might be released in beta, you might not have access to
    the feature. You can, however, sign up for Zapier’s **Early Access Program** to

    feature but rather an AI helper.

- en: When using AI apps with Zapier, a common problem that can arise is hitting token
    limits because the number of characters is too high. This is common when using
    large datasets in **Large Language Models** (**LLMs**) – for example, scraping
    data from web pages that you want to use in AI-related Zaps. With OpenAI, for
    example, one token could be four characters in an English word. More details on
    how OpenAI counts tokens can be found at [https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them).
    With the Formatter by Zapier Split Text into Chunks for AI Prompt (beta) transform
    option, you can take large bodies of text and modify the data to produce smaller
    bits to use in your AI prompts, therefore reducing the chance of experiencing
    errors with token limits being hit.

    increases using AI, as described in the *The Zapier ChatGPT plugin (beta) – running
    Zap actions from ChatGPT* section. You can find out more about ChatGPT at [https://openai.com/chatgpt](https://openai.com/chatgpt).
    With the ChatGPT integration, you can send prompts and save conversations that
    can later be recalled in other steps or Zaps, as well as use OpenAI’s **Function
    Calling** capability. Further details on Function Calling can be found at [https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates).
    Most importantly, the Zapier integration with ChatGPT allows some **ChatGPT Plus**
    account users to use OpenAI’s most advanced model, **GPT-4**, in Zaps, which is
    currently not available with the OpenAI integration.
