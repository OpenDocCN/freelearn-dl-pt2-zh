    in the human brain. It has been around for a decade, but the reason it is so popular
    right now is due to the computational advancements and availability of the huge
    volume of data. With a huge volume of data, deep learning algorithms outperform
    classic machine learning. It has already been transfiguring and extensively used
    in several interdisciplinary scientific fields such as computer vision, **natural
    language processing** (**NLP**), speech recognition, and many others.

- en: Deep learning is just a modern name for artificial neural networks with many
    layers. What is *deep* in deep learning though? It is basically due to the structure
    of the **artificial neural network** (**ANN**). ANN consists of some *n* number
    of layers to perform any computation. We can build an ANN with several layers
    where each layer is responsible for learning the intricate patterns in the data.
    Due to the computational advancements, we can build a network even with 100s or
    1000s of layers deep. Since the ANN uses deep layers to perform learning we call
    it as deep learning and when ANN uses deep layers to learn we call it as a deep
    network. We have learned that deep learning is a subset of machine learning. How
    does deep learning differ from machine learning? What makes deep learning so special
    and popular?

    plays a crucial role in machine learning. If we handcraft the right set of features
    to predict a certain outcome, then the machine learning algorithms can perform
    well, but finding and engineering the right set of features is not an easy task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With deep learning, we don't have to handcraft such features. Since deep ANNs
    employ several layers, it learns the complex intrinsic features and multi-level
    abstract representation of data by itself. Let's explore this a bit with an analogy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's suppose we want to perform an image classification task. Say, we are learning
    to recognize whether an image contains a dog or not. With machine learning, we
    need to handcraft features that help the model to understand whether the image
    contains a dog. We send these handcrafted features as inputs to machine learning
    algorithms which then learn a mapping between the features and the label (dog).
    But extracting features from an image is a tedious task. With deep learning, we
    just need to feed in a bunch of images to the deep neural networks, and it will
    automatically act as a feature extractor by learning the right set of features.
    As we have learned, ANN uses multiple layers; in the first layer, it will learn
    the basic features of the image that characterize the dog, say, the body structure
    of the dog, and, in the succeeding layers, it will learn the complex features.
    Once it learns the right set of features, it will look for the presence of such
    features in the image. If those features are present then it says that the given
    image contains a dog. Thus, unlike machine learning, with DL, we don't have to
    manually engineer the features, instead, the network will itself learns the correct
    set of features required for the task.

- en: Due to this interesting aspect of deep learning, it is substantially used in
    unstructured datasets where extracting features are difficult, such as speech
    recognition, text classification, and many more. When we have a fair amount of
    huge datasets, deep learning algorithms are good at extracting features and mapping
    the extracted features to their labels. Having said that, deep learning is not
    just throwing a bunch of data points to a deep network and getting results. It's
    not that simple either. We would have numerous hyperparameters that act as a tuning
    knob to obtain better results which we will explore in the upcoming sections.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although deep learning performs better than conventional machine learning models,
    it is not recommended to use DL for smaller datasets. When we don't have enough
    data points or the data is very simple, then the deep learning algorithms can
    easily overfit to the training dataset and fail to generalize well on the unseen
    dataset. Thus, we should apply deep learning only when we have a significant amount
    of data points.

    Amazon, and Spotify's recommendations engines, and self-driving cars are some
    of the applications powered by deep learning. There is no doubt that deep learning

    Neurons are the fundamental units of our brain and nervous system. Our brain encompasses
    approximately 100 billion neurons. Each and every neuron is connected to one another
    through a structure called a **synapse**, which is accountable for receiving input
    from the external environment, sensory organs for sending motor instructions to
    our muscles, and for performing other activities.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A neuron can also receive inputs from the other neurons through a branchlike
    structure called a **dendrite**. These inputs are strengthened or weakened; that
    is, they are weighted according to their importance and then they are summed together
    in the cell body called the **soma**. From the cell body, these summed inputs
    are processed and move through the **axons** and are sent to the other neurons.
