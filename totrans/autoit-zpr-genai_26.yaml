    with the product or service that their well-earned money is paying for. Of course,
    in order for your business to succeed and be competitive, your product or service
    needs to fulfill a need or solve a problem, and it should be of exceptional quality
    to ensure your customers come back to buy more. While you can have the best processes
    in place to market and sell your products and services, and have exceptional offerings
    with good value for money, if the processes behind production and delivery are
    extremely manual, repetitive, and error-prone, delivery will be poor, and the
    customers you worked so hard to find will run a mile. Inefficient operations processes
    could cause you to have significant delays in responding to customer service queries,
    or you might forget to respond altogether. It could also mean that you experience
    order processing delays in stages such as manufacturing or shipping because someone
    forgot to order a crucial component. Having inefficient and poorly organized operations
    processes generally creates stress for the team, and ultimately results in more
    time and expense being spent recruiting new employees because staff leave when
    their jobs are too difficult.

    at some point, someone in the business will be making a to-do list of some description.
    Most of us make lists of the things we need to accomplish, whether this is for
    personal use or for work. You might still like to record these items on paper
    or in your Notes app on your smartphone, or in a dedicated task management app.
    You might use Google Tasks, Todoist, or Microsoft To Do for your task recording
    and management. Many of these apps can help you with productivity by allowing
    you to create subtasks, set due dates and times, integrate with your calendar,
    and send yourself alerts. Once you have these apps set up, you can use Zapier
    to automate various other tasks based on triggers and actions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the Microsoft To Do integration, you can trigger workflows when new tasks
    or lists are created, a task is updated, or a task is completed. You can combine
    these triggers with action events to send an automated email with Microsoft Outlook,
    send an SMS with ClickSend SMS, or create tasks in Teamwork.com Projects, for
    example. You can also create a task or list, mark a task as complete, and find
    a task, and if one is not found, you can optionally create a task. Combine these
    actions with triggers to add new Facebook lead ads as tasks, add tasks when new
    messages are saved in Slack, or when new notes are added to OneNote.

    you need to manage simple or more complex projects with multiple tasks and categories,
    and if you need to assign tasks to different members of the team, customers, or
    contractors, it’s better to use a dedicated project management app. Although many
    businesses handle their project management processes on spreadsheets, using a
    dedicated project management app can, in many scenarios, allow you to visualize
    your tasks and projects in lists or Kanban views, as well as Gantt charts. These
    apps also help you display team schedules and availability, manage timelines,
    and allow notifications, comments, and communications. Trello, Asana, monday.com,
    Teamwork.com Projects, Zoho Projects, Wrike, and ClickUp are a few examples of
    project management apps that integrate with Zapier.
  prefs: []

    or lists are created or when a task changes. You can combine these triggers with
    action events to create and send an invoice in Xero or create and assign a new
    task within ClickUp itself. You can also create a task, subtask, folder, or list;
    add a new checklist to a task; post a comment or attachment to a task; and add
    time tracking to a task. Combine these actions with triggers such as new starred
    Gmail emails, new Google Form responses, or new GitHub issues.

- en: Every business will have either paper or online documents that they deal with
    from customers or suppliers, and potentially, internally from employees. Organizing
    your documents in a dedicated storage location means that you will be able to
    locate documents easily once you have stored them. In days gone by, many businesses
    used folders and filing cabinet systems to store paper documents, and some businesses
    may still do this. Nowadays, in the digital age, it’s common to store scanned
    versions of these paper documents or digital documents on a desktop computer or,
    preferably, in the cloud in a document storage app where those documents can be
    accessed from any location. Apps such as Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, and
    Box are popular online storage solutions, which, once implemented, can be integrated
    with Zapier so that you can automate document storage. For example, you might
    receive documents by email that you need to then file in your online document
    storage app, you might need to store a PDF copy of a contract in a specific location
    once it has been signed, or you might want to save an image once it has been posted
    to Facebook Pages.

    to a folder or when a folder is added. You can combine these triggers with action
    events to copy new files to another storage app, such as Google Drive or Dropbox,
    or add new notes to Evernote with attachments, for example. You can also upload
    a file, create a folder or new text file, and search for a file or folder, and
    if they are not found, you can optionally create a file or folder. Combine these
    actions with triggers to upload new Google Docs files, Gmail attachments, or YouTube
    videos.

    added to any folder, a new file is added to a specific folder, a folder is added,
    or when a file is updated. You can combine this trigger with action events to
    send team notifications with Slack or create new Asana tasks, for example. You
    can also upload a file; create a folder; create a file from text; copy, move,
    or replace a file; or add file-sharing preferences. You can also search for a
    file or folder, and if it is not found, you can optionally create a file or folder.
    Combine these actions with triggers to add new Instagram images, create folders
    when deals are marked as won in your CRM, or when new Google Calendar events are
    created in order to back them up.

    with each other internally, with prospective and existing customers, and with
    suppliers. Communication methods have changed significantly for businesses over
    the years, where perhaps some time ago, the only methods were face-to-face verbal
    conversations, or by telegraph, telephone, or fax. Now, many companies rely on
    other forms of communication such as email, SMS, telephone calls and voicemail
    drops, video conferencing, and online messaging tools. You might be using Gmail
    or Microsoft Outlook for your emails; Slack, Google Hangouts Chat, or Microsoft
    Teams for team collaboration; Zoom or GoToMeeting for video conferencing; RingCentral
    for voice calls, sending fax, and SMS; VoodooSMS for sending SMS; and Slybroadcast
    for voice drops. There is such a broad range of communication apps that integrate
    with Zapier, enabling you to automate many, if not all, of your communication
    processes.

    and teams embrace remote working and collaboration. The platform supports video
    and voice meetings, as well as webinars. With Zoom integration, you can trigger
    workflows when a new meeting or webinar is created, a new registrant is added
    to a webinar, or a new recording is completed for a meeting or webinar. You can
    combine these triggers with action events to add new registrants to ClickFunnels,
    create new Google Calendar events, or send a notification in Slack. You can also
    create a new meeting or webinar registrant. You can combine these action events
    with triggers such as when new Eventbrite orders are created, successful PayPal
    sales are made, or new Calendly events are created.

    or manual word processor to create documents that need to be faxed or posted.
    These days, companies generally use desktop word processing and presentation packages
    such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint. A lot more can be achieved by
    using cloud-based alternatives such as Google Docs or Zoho Writer, for example,
    as well as Google Slides. Zapier integrates with these cloud-based apps and many
    more, allowing you to automate your text and presentation document processes.

    is created. You can combine this trigger with action events such as posting presentations
    to a Slack channel or tweeting the presentation on Twitter. You can also search
    for an existing presentation, create a presentation from a template using mail
    merge placeholder variables, or refresh data for all charts in a presentation
    linked to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. You can combine these action events with
    triggers such as when data is parsed from PDFs in Docparser, when deals reach
    a certain stage in Zoho CRM, or when forms are submitted in Gravity Forms.

    spreadsheets and databases, allowing them to access the data from anywhere if
    they are using a cloud-based app such as Google Sheets, Smartsheet, Airtable,

    processes involving recording, amending, sharing, and reporting on data in these
    online tools.

    added to a worksheet or table in a spreadsheet, when a row is added or updated,
    or when a new worksheet is added to a spreadsheet. You can combine these triggers
    with action events such as creating a new deal in your CRM, adding new rows to
    a Google spreadsheet, or adding new subscribers to ConvertKit. You can also add
    a new row to the end of a specific worksheet or table, update a row in a specific
    worksheet, create a new spreadsheet, search for an existing row by column or value,
    and optionally, create a new row if one is not found. You can combine these action
    events with triggers such as when new **SurveyMonkey** responses are created,
    with new **Formstack** submissions, or when **Toggl** time entries are made.

    Google Sheets, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Analytics, and Google
    Ads. Google Docs is a popular online word processor app that allows you to create
    and edit text documents as well as to invite and collaborate with other people.
    Collaborators can make changes and add comments in real time. You can also upload
    a Word document and convert it into a Google Docs format, view your document’s
    revision history, and translate the document into different languages. You can
    download documents in other file formats, such as Word, RTF, PDF, HTML, OpenOffice,
    or as a `.zip` file, or email documents as attachments. If you’re a die-hard fan
    of Microsoft Word but want a cloud-based word processor with similar features
