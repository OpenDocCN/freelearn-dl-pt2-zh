- en: Once you’ve made those ever-important sales, you need to provide your customers
    with the product or service that their well-earned money is paying for. Of course,
    in order for your business to succeed and be competitive, your product or service
    needs to fulfill a need or solve a problem, and it should be of exceptional quality
    to ensure your customers come back to buy more. While you can have the best processes
    in place to market and sell your products and services, and have exceptional offerings
    with good value for money, if the processes behind production and delivery are
    extremely manual, repetitive, and error-prone, delivery will be poor, and the
    customers you worked so hard to find will run a mile. Inefficient operations processes
    could cause you to have significant delays in responding to customer service queries,
    or you might forget to respond altogether. It could also mean that you experience
    order processing delays in stages such as manufacturing or shipping because someone
    forgot to order a crucial component. Having inefficient and poorly organized operations
    processes generally creates stress for the team, and ultimately results in more
    time and expense being spent recruiting new employees because staff leave when
    their jobs are too difficult.

    at some point, someone in the business will be making a to-do list of some description.
    Most of us make lists of the things we need to accomplish, whether this is for
    personal use or for work. You might still like to record these items on paper
    or in your Notes app on your smartphone, or in a dedicated task management app.
    You might use Google Tasks, Todoist, or Microsoft To Do for your task recording
    and management. Many of these apps can help you with productivity by allowing
    you to create subtasks, set due dates and times, integrate with your calendar,
    and send yourself alerts. Once you have these apps set up, you can use Zapier
    to automate various other tasks based on triggers and actions.

    Notes 应用程序上记录这些项目，或使用专门的任务管理应用程序。你可能会使用 Google 任务、Todoist 或 Microsoft To Do 来记录和管理任务。其中许多应用程序可以通过允许你创建子任务、设置截止日期和时间、与你的日历集成以及发送提醒来帮助你提高生产力。一旦设置好这些应用程序，你可以使用
    Zapier 根据触发器和操作自动化各种其他任务。
- en: With the Microsoft To Do integration, you can trigger workflows when new tasks
    or lists are created, a task is updated, or a task is completed. You can combine
    these triggers with action events to send an automated email with Microsoft Outlook,
    send an SMS with ClickSend SMS, or create tasks in Teamwork.com Projects, for
    example. You can also create a task or list, mark a task as complete, and find
    a task, and if one is not found, you can optionally create a task. Combine these
    actions with triggers to add new Facebook lead ads as tasks, add tasks when new
    messages are saved in Slack, or when new notes are added to OneNote.

    Facebook lead 广告添加为任务，将新消息保存在 Slack 中的任务添加为任务，或将新的 OneNote 笔记添加为任务。
- en: Task management apps help you maintain individual productivity. However, when
    you need to manage simple or more complex projects with multiple tasks and categories,
    and if you need to assign tasks to different members of the team, customers, or
    contractors, it’s better to use a dedicated project management app. Although many
    businesses handle their project management processes on spreadsheets, using a
    dedicated project management app can, in many scenarios, allow you to visualize
    your tasks and projects in lists or Kanban views, as well as Gantt charts. These
    apps also help you display team schedules and availability, manage timelines,
    and allow notifications, comments, and communications. Trello, Asana, monday.com,
    Teamwork.com Projects, Zoho Projects, Wrike, and ClickUp are a few examples of
    project management apps that integrate with Zapier.

  zh: 任务管理应用程序有助于你维护个人生产力。然而，当你需要管理具有多个任务和类别的简单或更复杂的项目，并且如果你需要将任务分配给团队的不同成员、客户或承包商，最好使用专门的项目管理应用程序。虽然许多企业在电子表格上处理其项目管理过程，但使用专门的项目管理应用程序在许多情况下可以让您在列表或看板视图以及甘特图中可视化您的任务和项目。这些应用程序还可以帮助你显示团队的时间表和可用性、管理时间线，并允许通知、评论和交流。例如，Trello、Asana、monday.com、Teamwork.com
    项目、Zoho 项目、Wrike 和 ClickUp 是一些与 Zapier 集成的项目管理应用程序的示例。
- en: With the ClickUp integration, you can trigger workflows when new tasks, folders,
    or lists are created or when a task changes. You can combine these triggers with
    action events to create and send an invoice in Xero or create and assign a new
    task within ClickUp itself. You can also create a task, subtask, folder, or list;
    add a new checklist to a task; post a comment or attachment to a task; and add
    time tracking to a task. Combine these actions with triggers such as new starred
    Gmail emails, new Google Form responses, or new GitHub issues.

- en: Every business will have either paper or online documents that they deal with
    from customers or suppliers, and potentially, internally from employees. Organizing
    your documents in a dedicated storage location means that you will be able to
    locate documents easily once you have stored them. In days gone by, many businesses
    used folders and filing cabinet systems to store paper documents, and some businesses
    may still do this. Nowadays, in the digital age, it’s common to store scanned
    versions of these paper documents or digital documents on a desktop computer or,
    preferably, in the cloud in a document storage app where those documents can be
    accessed from any location. Apps such as Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, and
    Box are popular online storage solutions, which, once implemented, can be integrated
    with Zapier so that you can automate document storage. For example, you might
    receive documents by email that you need to then file in your online document
    storage app, you might need to store a PDF copy of a contract in a specific location
    once it has been signed, or you might want to save an image once it has been posted
    to Facebook Pages.

    a file, create a folder or new text file, and search for a file or folder, and

    file or folder, and if it is not found, you can optionally create a file or folder.

    suppliers. Communication methods have changed significantly for businesses over
    the years, where perhaps some time ago, the only methods were face-to-face verbal
    conversations, or by telegraph, telephone, or fax. Now, many companies rely on
    other forms of communication such as email, SMS, telephone calls and voicemail
    drops, video conferencing, and online messaging tools. You might be using Gmail
    or Microsoft Outlook for your emails; Slack, Google Hangouts Chat, or Microsoft
    Teams for team collaboration; Zoom or GoToMeeting for video conferencing; RingCentral
    for voice calls, sending fax, and SMS; VoodooSMS for sending SMS; and Slybroadcast

    using cloud-based alternatives such as Google Docs or Zoho Writer, for example,

    merge placeholder variables, or refresh data for all charts in a presentation
    linked to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. You can combine these action events with

    a Google spreadsheet, or adding new subscribers to ConvertKit. You can also add
    a new row to the end of a specific worksheet or table, update a row in a specific
    worksheet, create a new spreadsheet, search for an existing row by column or value,
    and optionally, create a new row if one is not found. You can combine these action

- en: Zapier currently integrates with 20 apps in the Google suite of tools, including
    Google Sheets, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Analytics, and Google
    Ads. Google Docs is a popular online word processor app that allows you to create
    and edit text documents as well as to invite and collaborate with other people.
    Collaborators can make changes and add comments in real time. You can also upload
    a Word document and convert it into a Google Docs format, view your document’s
    revision history, and translate the document into different languages. You can
    download documents in other file formats, such as Word, RTF, PDF, HTML, OpenOffice,
    or as a `.zip` file, or email documents as attachments. If you’re a die-hard fan
    of Microsoft Word but want a cloud-based word processor with similar features
    and functions with the added bonus of being able to collaborate in real time and
    integrate it with connector tools such as Zapier, you won’t go wrong with Google
    Docs.

    Docs格式，查看文档的修订历史，并将文档翻译成不同的语言。您可以以其他文件格式下载文档，例如Word、RTF、PDF、HTML、OpenOffice，或者作为`.zip`文件发送电子邮件。如果您是Microsoft
