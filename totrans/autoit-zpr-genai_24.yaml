    automations with Zapier and how to use the various built-in apps, including Formatter
    by Zapier, to boost your automations. Now that we’ve covered those topics, it
    will be useful to go into more detail regarding the different types of business
    processes that can be automated by using Zapier as a connector tool between thousands
    of business applications. In the following few chapters, we will cover how to
    automate processes in five of the central business functions, namely marketing,
    sales, operations, finance, and analytics, and explore examples relating to some
    commonly used digital tools that integrate with Zapier. We will also go into more
    detail about how to use one specific integration related to each function.

    an important one at that. All businesses need marketing processes to varying degrees
    to ensure they have a way of attracting potential customers. In this chapter,
    we will discuss the different types of marketing processes that can be automated
    with Zapier, and we will provide examples of workflows used with some common marketing
    applications. First, we will take an overview of the types of marketing processes
    that can be automated with Zapier. Then, we will explore where to start with automating
    marketing processes with Zapier. Finally, we will dive into how to automate social

    physically through the door or purchasing their products and services online.
    What every business strives for is lead generation by means of word of mouth or
    recommendation; in other words, getting your valued and happy customers to do
    the marketing work for you. However, when you’re first starting out, the onus
    is on the business to get its name out there in one way or another. In the past,
    some of the most popular forms of marketing were newspaper and magazine ads, leaflet
    drops, radio ads, and, for those who could afford it, television ads, where customers
    were often limited to specific geographical areas. In this digital age, where
    we have the far reaches of the internet to attract everyone, businesses have more
    tools and services available for cost-effective marketing. However, with more
    options come more things that we need to do to stay ahead of the competition.

    buyers can find them, and that might be a website or a **Google My Business**
    page. Your website might have a blog so that you can improve your searchability
    on search engines such as Google. You might need to share your blog articles on
    your various social media channels, while engaging your followers with useful
    content, memes, and motivational posts, or strategic social media campaigns to
    drive traffic back to your website. You might embed forms into your website to
    allow people to subscribe to your newsletter. You might have landing pages to
    help you collect email addresses or prospects to add to your marketing campaigns.
    You might also use digital ads to increase traffic to these dedicated landing
    pages. All this effort, and all these tools being used, are purely for the purpose
    of getting an audience into your sales cycle and buying your product or service.

    that starts with a website. To help improve search engine optimization, it is
    generally recommended that you have a blog where you publish new and relevant
    content regularly. You might use **Tumblr**, **WordPress**, **Drupal**, or **Webflow**
    to manage your website and blog content.
  prefs: []

    to automate some of the related processes. One popular website builder and blog
    that integrates with Zapier is WordPress. You can use Zapier to automate your
    WordPress blog processes, such as creating, updating, and sharing new content,
    as well as managing comments and users. You can trigger workflows when you receive
    new comments, when a new user is added, when posts are added or updated, and when
    new media is added. Combine these trigger events with action events in notification
    apps such as Email by Zapier to get an email, social media apps such as Twitter
    or Medium to share new posts, or a Google Sheets spreadsheet to add new users
    to a list. You can also create new posts, update existing posts, upload media,
    create new users, and search for posts when, for example, new images are added
    to Google Drive or new users are added to your CRM, **Dubsado**, or task management
    app, Asana.

    shops, dentists, or legal firms, may advertise their business on services such
    as Google My Business. With this type of service, you can advertise your opening
    hours and contact details, and collect customer reviews. Using Google My Business
    also increases your searchability on Google. As Google My Business integrates
    with Zapier, you can use Zapier to connect to other apps in your processes and
    automate your online presence. For example, you can trigger workflows when you
    receive a new review and get notifications such as a Slack message or SMS. You
    can respond to specific reviews, as soon as you receive a new review, or update
    a reply when a record appears in a view in Airtable.

    existing customers. You might only use one or perhaps several social media platforms,
    depending on the needs of your business. To name a few, these could be Facebook
    Groups, Twitter, Instagram for Business, or **Pinterest**, for example. Whatever
    your social media marketing processes are, there will be ways to connect your
    tools and automate those processes with Zapier.

    new videos or photos are posted to your account or when your account is tagged
    in a photo or video. You could combine these triggers with action events to share

    also publish a new photo to your feed when, for example, you publish new Shopify

    Writing the content, designing graphics, planning when to post it, and then actually
    doing the posting can take some time and be a very manual process. Using social
    media scheduling tools such as **Buffer**, **Meet Edgar**, and **Hootsuite** can
    make lighter work of part of that process by helping you post to multiple social
    media platforms at once on days and at times of your choosing. Being able to then
    automate processes involving these scheduling apps makes things even easier. You
    can, therefore, use Zapier to automate many social media scheduling workflows.

    from you is to use email marketing or marketing automation. In order to use these
    methods, once you’ve pushed new prospects to your website or specific landing
    pages using social media or ads, you first of all need to collect the email addresses
    of your contacts so that you can send them new free but valuable content, let
    them know of special offers, or introduce them to your team and services. You
    might do this by embedding forms into your website to allow people to subscribe
    to your newsletter, or setting up landing pages with free downloads such as cheat
    sheets, e-books, or fun quizzes to help you collect email addresses so that you
    can add them to your marketing campaigns.

    events you can use, which we won’t discuss here. However, for the marketing functionality,
    you can trigger workflows when a campaign starts sending emails, a campaign bounces,
    links in a campaign have been clicked, a contact unsubscribes from a campaign,
    or a campaign email is opened. You can combine these triggers with action events
    such as getting notifications in Slack or by email using Email by Zapier or posting
    new campaigns to your Facebook Page. You can also find a contact, create contacts,
    add them to automations, create and send a new campaign, or add a tracked event
    when, for example, you have new Thinkific orders, get new form entries from Google
    Forms or **JotForm**, close a **ManyChat** chat, or receive a PayPal sale.
