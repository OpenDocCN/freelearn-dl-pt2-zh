- en: In the internet age, where an increasing volume of text data is being generated
    daily from social media and other platforms, being able to make sense of that
    data is a crucial skill. This book will help you build deep learning models for
    **Natural Language Processing** (**NLP**) tasks that will help you extract valuable
    insights from text.

- en: We will start by understanding how to install PyTorch and using CUDA to accelerate
    the processing speed. You'll then explore how the NLP architecture works through
    practical examples. Later chapters will guide you through important principles,
    such as word embeddings, CBOW, and tokenization in PyTorch. You'll then learn
    some techniques for processing textual data and how deep learning can be used
    for NLP tasks. Next, we will demonstrate how to implement deep learning and neural
    network architectures to build models that allow you to classify and translate
    text and perform sentiment analysis. Finally, you will learn how to build advanced
    NLP models, such as conversational chatbots.

    solved using deep learning with PyTorch, as well as how to build models to solve
    them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This PyTorch book is for NLP developers, machine learning and deep learning
    developers, or anyone working toward building intelligent language applications
    using both traditional NLP approaches and deep learning architectures. If you're
    looking to adopt modern NLP techniques and models for your development projects,
    then this book is for you. Working knowledge of Python programming and basic working
    knowledge of NLP tasks are a must.

    have been tested using version 3.7\. You will also need a working PyTorch environment
    for the deep learning components of this book. All deep learning models were constructed
    using version 1.4; however, the majority of the code should work with later versions.
