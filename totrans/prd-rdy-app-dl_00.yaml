- en: With the growing interest in **artificial intelligence** (**AI**), there are
    millions of resources introducing various **deep learning** (**DL**) techniques
    for a wide range of problems. They might be sufficient to get you a data scientist
    position that many of your friends dream of. However, you will soon find out that
    the real difficulty with DL projects is not only selecting the right algorithm
    for the given problem but also efficiently preprocessing the necessary data in
    the right format and providing a stable service.

- en: This book walks you through every step of a DL project. We start from a proof-of-concept
    model written in a notebook and transform the model into a service or application
    with the goal of maximizing user satisfaction upon deployment. Then, we use **Amazon
    Web Services** (**AWS**) to efficiently provide a stable service. Additionally,
    we look at how to monitor a system running a DL model after deployment, closing
    the loop completely.

- en: Throughout the book, we focus on introducing various techniques that engineers
    at the frontier of the technology use daily to meet strict service specifications.

    in deploying DL applications at scale and will be able to overcome these challenges
    in the most efficient and effective way.

    Learning Projects*, describes the first steps of a DL project, data collection
    and data preparation. In this chapter, we cover how to prepare a notebook setting
    for the project, collect the necessary data, and process it effectively for training
    a DL model.'
