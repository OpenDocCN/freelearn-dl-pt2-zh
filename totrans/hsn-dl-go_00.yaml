- en: Go is an open source programming language designed by Google to handle huge
    projects efficiently. It makes building reliable, simple, and efficient software
    straightforward and easy.

- en: This book immediately jumps into the practicalities of implementing **Deep Neural
    Networks** (**DNNs**) in Go. Simply put, the book's title contains its aim. This
    means there will be a lot of technical detail, a lot of code, and (not too much)
    math. By the time you finally close the book or turn off your Kindle, you'll know
    how (and why) to implement modern, scalable DNNs, and be able to repurpose them
    for your needs in whatever industry or mad science project you're involved.
