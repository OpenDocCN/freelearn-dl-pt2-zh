    help you prepare to automate your processes. As we discussed in the previous chapter,
    it is vital to simplify your processes before attempting to automate them. Therefore,
    we will start by describing how to improve your business processes and then identify
    what can be automated. We will then explore how to find information about your
    business apps and how your apps integrate with Zapier. We will expand on this
    in the *Getting the most out of the* *Zapier* *app ecosystem directory* section
    of this chapter, where we will cover navigation in the directory of app integrations
    and how to find new apps to use.

    essential to analyze, understand, and simplify your existing manual processes.
    Following this method will ensure that you have more robust processes, as well
    as help reduce the number of steps you have in your Zaps. This will help lower
    the number of tasks that will contribute to your monthly Zapier task limit when
    your workflows run.

    will need to employ someone with analytical skills to help you detail your processes
    in flowcharts and documents. You may also believe that it does not apply to you
    or your business. The fact is that you most likely already map out your processes
    in one way or another, such as when you create training documents and checklists
    for new staff. Having documented procedures allows you, the business owner, the
    manager, and the team members that use the process to have a clear view of how
    specific tasks are meant to be done consistently. All businesses, small or large,
    can benefit from documenting the way they do things; we will break this down into
    an easy-to-follow exercise to help you accomplish this.

    important if you have a team (small or large) and tasks that span different departments
    or roles. Including all relevant team members will ensure engagement and empowerment
    in the change process and allow teams to take ownership of and manage the processes
    collaboratively on an ongoing basis. It is also essential to explain the purpose
    of the exercise (remember your top-level goals) and remind your team that automation
    will help them do their jobs better and more efficiently. Encouraging your team
    to learn how to use BPA in their daily roles will boost productivity and job satisfaction.

    the SaaS industry is becoming more competitive, and even smaller providers offer
    one-on-one walk-through demos, which then allow you, the potential buyer, to ask
    questions tailored to your use case. Simply enquire with their customer service
    team to assess the possibility of a product demo if one is not explicitly offered
    on the website of the software provider. Providing some flexibility while providing
