- en: In this chapter, we will use the principles of business process automation to
    help you prepare to automate your processes. As we discussed in the previous chapter,
    it is vital to simplify your processes before attempting to automate them. Therefore,
    we will start by describing how to improve your business processes and then identify
    what can be automated. We will then explore how to find information about your
    business apps and how your apps integrate with Zapier. We will expand on this
    in the *Getting the most out of the* *Zapier* *app ecosystem directory* section
    of this chapter, where we will cover navigation in the directory of app integrations
    and how to find new apps to use.

    Zapier 集成的信息。我们将在本章的 *充分利用* *Zapier* *应用生态系统目录* 部分展开讨论，其中我们将介绍如何在应用集成目录中导航以及如何查找新的应用程序以使用。

    will need to employ someone with analytical skills to help you detail your processes
    in flowcharts and documents. You may also believe that it does not apply to you
    or your business. The fact is that you most likely already map out your processes
    in one way or another, such as when you create training documents and checklists
    for new staff. Having documented procedures allows you, the business owner, the
    manager, and the team members that use the process to have a clear view of how
    specific tasks are meant to be done consistently. All businesses, small or large,
    can benefit from documenting the way they do things; we will break this down into
    an easy-to-follow exercise to help you accomplish this.

    collaboratively on an ongoing basis. It is also essential to explain the purpose
    of the exercise (remember your top-level goals) and remind your team that automation
    will help them do their jobs better and more efficiently. Encouraging your team

    becoming a more popular industry, the release of thousands of new applications

    Equally, if you are looking for a new app to digitize your existing processes,

    apps and processes so that you know how apps and processes link together. It is
    also essential to identify the most key application in your business – the app
    that you consider to be the one source of truth. For example, this might be your
    **Customer Relationship Management** (**CRM**) tool or your project management
    tool. If this app is key to your business, knowing what apps it integrates with
    natively and in what way will allow you to make better decisions about the new
    apps you intend to introduce. As we discussed in [*Chapter 1*](B18474_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014),
    *Introduction to Business Process Automation with Zapier*, your cloud-based apps
    are most likely to have a list of other apps that they integrate with natively
    and can be found in that app’s marketplace or ecosystem.

    a tool, more than a free trial will. You might initially think that only larger
    software providers provide demonstrations of their products. As mentioned earlier,
    the SaaS industry is becoming more competitive, and even smaller providers offer
    one-on-one walk-through demos, which then allow you, the potential buyer, to ask
    questions tailored to your use case. Simply enquire with their customer service
    team to assess the possibility of a product demo if one is not explicitly offered
    on the website of the software provider. Providing some flexibility while providing
    a demo will also give you an indication of what customer support and service levels
    are likely to be once you have committed to purchasing the product.
