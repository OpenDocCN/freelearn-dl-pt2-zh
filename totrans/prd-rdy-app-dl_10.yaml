    In many cases, the deployment settings are different from the development settings
    and the discrepancy can introduce various restrictions. In this part, we introduce
    common issues that engineers often struggle with and share effective solutions
    for each challenge. In the final chapter, we describe the last phase of a deep
    learning project, which consists of evaluating the project and discussing potential
    improvements for future projects.
