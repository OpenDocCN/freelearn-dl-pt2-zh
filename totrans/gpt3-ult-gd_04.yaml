- en: GPT-3, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, is a transformer-based large
    language model developed by OpenAI. It consists of a staggering 175 billion parameters.
    Anyone can access this large language model via the OpenAI API, a simple-to-use
    “text-in, text-out” user interface, without any technical prerequisites. This
    is the first time in history that an AI model as big as GPT-3 has been remotely
    hosted and made available to the general public with a simple API call. This new
    mode of access is called model-as-a-service.  Because of this unprecedented access,
    many people, including the authors of this book, see GPT-3 as a first step towards
    democratizing artificial intelligence (AI).

- en: With the introduction of GPT-3, it is easier than ever before to build AI applications.
    This book will show you how easy it is to get started with the OpenAI API. Also,
    we’ll introduce you to innovative ways to leverage this tool for your use case.
    We’ll look at successful startups built on top of GPT-3 and corporations leveraging
    it in their product landscape and examine problems and potential future trends
    in its development.

    in these subjects. In Chapter 2, we do a deep dive into the API, breaking it down
    into the most critical elements, such as engines and endpoints, describing their
    purpose and best practices for readers who wish to interact with them on a deeper
    level. Chapter 3 provides a simple and fun recipe for your first GPT-3 powered
    application.

    founders of some of the most successful GPT-3 based products and apps about their
    struggles and experiences interacting with the model on a commercial scale. Chapter
    5 looks at how enterprises view GPT-3 and its adoption potential. We discuss the
    problematic implications of wider GPT-3 adoption, such as misuse and bias, and
    progress in addressing those issues in Chapter 6\. Finally, in Chapter 7, we look
    to the future, walking you through the most exciting trends and possibilities
    arising as  GPT-3 settles into the broader commercial ecosystem.
