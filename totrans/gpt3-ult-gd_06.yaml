    human language) with machine learning to create intelligent machines capable of
    identifying the context and understanding the intent of natural language. Machine
    learning is a branch of AI that focuses on the study of how machines can improve
    their performance on tasks through experiences without being explicitly programmed
    to do so. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves using
    neural networks modeled after the human brain to perform complex tasks with minimal
    human intervention.

    came large language models consisting of dense neural networks composed of thousands
    or even millions of simple processing units called artificial neurons. Neural
    networks became the first significant game-changer in the field of NLP by making
    it feasible to perform complex natural language tasks, which had been possible
    only in theory so far. The second major milestone was the introduction of pre-trained
    models (such as GPT-3) that could be fine-tuned on various downstream tasks, saving
    many hours of training. (We discuss pre-trained models later in this chapter.)

    in a text in a specific language. Based on a statistical analysis of existing
    text sequences, simple language models can look at a word and predict the next
    word (or words) most likely to follow. To create a language model that successfully
    predicts word sequences, you must train it on large data sets.

    will discuss GPT-3’s extraordinary capabilities as a general language model. We’ll
    start this chapter by walking you through each letter of “GPT” to show what they
    stand for and what are the elements with which the famous model was built. We’ll
    give a brief overview of the model’s history and how the sequence-to-sequence
    models we see today came into the picture. After that, we will walk you through
    the importance of API access and how it evolved based on users' demands. We recommend
    signing up for an OpenAI account before you move on to the rest of the chapters.

    skill you develop to help you acquire another faster. For example, mastering the
    craft of solving math problems can allow you to acquire the skill of solving engineering
    problems faster. A pre-trained model is trained (by you or someone else) for a
    more general task and can be fine-tuned for different tasks. Instead of creating
    a brand new model to address your issue, you can use a pre-trained model that
    has already been trained on a more general problem. The pre-trained model can
    be fine-tuned to address your specific needs by providing additional training
    with a tailored dataset. This approach is faster and more efficient and allows
    for improved performance compared to building a model from scratch.

    to clarify what kind of content the OpenAI API can be used to generate. To help
    developers ensure their applications are used for the intended purpose, prevent
    potential misuse, and adhere to the content guidelines, OpenAI offers a free content
    filter. OpenAI policy prohibits the use of the API in ways that do not adhere
    to the principles described in its [charter](https://openai.com/charter/), including
    content that promotes hate, violence, or self-harm, or that intends to harass,
    influence political processes, spread misinformation, spam content, and so on.
