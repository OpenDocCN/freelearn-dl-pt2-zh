- en: We've seen big changes in **Natural Language Processing** (**NLP**) over the
    last 20 years. During this time, we have experienced different paradigms and finally
    entered a new era dominated by the magical transformer architecture. This deep
    learning architecture has come about by inheriting many approaches. Contextual
    word embeddings, multi-head self-attention, positional encoding, parallelizable
    architectures, model compression, transfer learning, and cross-lingual models
    are among those approaches. Starting with the help of various neural-based NLP
    approaches, the transformer architecture gradually evolved into an attention-based
    encoder-decoder architecture and continues to evolve to this day. Now, we are
    seeing new successful variants of this architecture in the literature. Great models
    have emerged that use only the encoder part of it, such as BERT, or only the decoder
    part of it, such as GPT.

    to work with transformer models easily thanks to the Transformers library from
    the Hugging Face community. We will provide the solutions step by step to a wide
    variety of NLP problems, ranging from summarization to question-answering. We
    will see that we can achieve state-of-the-art results with the help of transformers.
