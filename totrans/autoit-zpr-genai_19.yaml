- en: So far in this book, we’ve covered two important functions of the versatile
    Formatter by Zapier built-in app. In [*Chapter 14*](B18474_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor1580),
    *Formatting Date and Time*, we discussed how to use Formatter by Zapier to manipulate
    dates and times. In [*Chapter 15*](B18474_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor1653), *Formatting
    Numbers*, we covered how to use it to transform numbers. As covered in those two
    chapters, being able to transform text into a variety of different formats is
    incredibly useful. For example, the name of a contact may be displayed in full
    (as a first name and surname), and you may want to split out the first name so
    that you can personalize an email rather than using the contact’s full name. Or
    you might want to extract an email address from a block of text to be able to
    add that to your marketing automation software. You might also want to truncate
    text to a specified character length when sharing a summary of content on Twitter.
    There are many possibilities for when you might need to adjust text, and that
    is where the Formatter by Zapier **Text** action event comes in. Users familiar
    with Microsoft Excel will see similarities between this Zapier functionality and
    text transformation formula usage in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.

    built-in app, and you will learn how to use some of the extensive functionality
    available to format text. First, we will discuss how to use Zapier to transform
    text values in general. Next, we will explore capitalizing text, applying title
    case, uppercase, and lowercase, and pluralizing words. Then, we will cover finding
    the position of and replacing text, counting characters and words, and removing
    whitespace.

    to ensure that, where appropriate, words in a bunch of text display capital letters
    at the start of the word. This is especially important when addressing people
    by name or displaying business names and addresses on invoices. You can capitalize
    the first letter of every word in a string of text using the Formatter by Zapier
    `this is a test`, the transformed text would be `This Is A Test`. Microsoft Excel
    users will recognize the similarity of this Zapier functionality to the `PROPER`
    formula in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to capitalize text.

    appears in a string of text. You can use the Formatter by Zapier `green` in a
    string of text such as `green is a wonderful color`, the returned value would
    be `0`. If the string of text were `isn't green a wonderful color?`, the returned
    value would be `6`. If the search term does not exist in the string of text, the
    value that is returned would be `-1`. You can also skip several characters that
    you do not want to be included in the search. For example, if the text string
    is `plum and apple and pear and plum`, we can ignore the first position of the
    word `plum` by skipping the first four or more characters in the string during
    the search. This returns a result of position `28` for the start of the second
    occurrence of the word `plum` in the string.
