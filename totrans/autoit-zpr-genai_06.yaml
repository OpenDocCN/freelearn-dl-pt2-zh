- en: As you get more familiar with Zapier and start to build complex workflows, you
    are likely to run into problems occasionally with your workflows. In general,
    when errors occur, they might originate from the way the Zap was set up, from
    issues with one of the apps in the workflow, or from general performance problems
    of the Zapier app itself. The best way to learn how to address these problems
    is to do some initial investigation work yourself before reaching out for additional
    help.

    to deal with unexpected errors when using Zapier. We will begin by discussing
    how to manage Zap error notifications by adjusting your account settings, and
    by setting up a Zap with the **Zapier Manager** built-in app. Then, we will cover
    how to manage app status alerts by monitoring the **Zapier Status** page, and
    by setting up a Zap with the **App Status by Zapier** built-in app. After, we
    will show you how to best use Zap history information to assess how your Zaps
    have run and to gather information to help with troubleshooting. Lastly, we will
    cover the channels available to seek additional support on the Zapier platform.

    your processes can run on autopilot while you focus on other things. You will,
    however, want to know when your workflows run into errors so that you can address
    any problems promptly, to ensure continuity. Zapier monitors all Zaps for performance
    when they are running. Whenever a fault is detected with the way any of your Zaps
    are expected to work, Zapier will highlight that a problem has occurred. The best
    way to monitor any problems with your workflows and deal with them quickly is
    to ensure you receive notifications when any issues arise.

    you are the system administrator for the Zapier account and need to receive alerts
    because perhaps you don’t have access to the Zapier account owner’s emails to
    receive email notifications. It is also handy for Team or Company account users
    for the same reason.

    alerts, as well as for issues with connected apps in your Zaps. As discussed in
    [*Chapter 1*](B18474_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014), *Introduction to Business Process
    Automation with Zapier*, you can adjust the frequency of these alerts in the **Email
    Notification** area of your account settings. For Professional, Team, and Company
    accounts, custom error notification settings can be directly accessed via the
    **Custom error notifications** button in the **Zap** **history** area.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Once you have turned the **Autoreplay** function **On**, if a step in a workflow
    event fails, Zapier will attempt to retry it up to five times using the following
    schedule: after 5 minutes, after another 30 minutes, after another 1 hour, after
    another 3 hours, and finally after another 6 hours. Therefore, the last attempt
    to replay the task would be 10 hours and 35 minutes after the original error occurred.
    Zapier would not send error emails or trigger Zapier Manager until all replay
    attempts in the schedule had been completed, and only if the task failed to replay
    on the final attempt. During this time, you will not be able to manually replay
    a task, and all tasks that are being replayed or are scheduled to be replayed
    will display a status of **Waiting Scheduled**. The **Autoreplay** function will
    only start when the workflow event experiences errors; however, any tasks that
    have a status of **Halted**, **Errored**, and **Filtered** will be replayed. Triggers
    will never show as errored and do not replay because of the mechanism used for
    finding new data.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the replay schedule is running, you can make small changes to your Zap
    to attempt to address any errors, and the **Autoreplay** function will incorporate
    these changes into the next scheduled replay. If, however, your Zap is switched
    off at the exact time the next replay is due or the **Autoreplay** function is
    turned off, all further scheduled attempts will be canceled.

- en: Understanding why tasks have not replayed
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may find that after manually replaying tasks or when using the **Autoreplay**
    function, some of your tasks have still not replayed. This might happen if your
    Zap has been turned **Off** or is paused, if it has been deleted, or if significant
    changes have been made to it since the error occurred (as opposed to small adjustments).
    Zapier will send you notifications to remind you that tasks can be replayed before
    the replay time expires. Zap runs over 30 days old, those that have already successfully
    run, and those that are replaying or scheduled to be replayed cannot be replayed.
