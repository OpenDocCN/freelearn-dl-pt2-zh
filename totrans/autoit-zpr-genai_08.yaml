- en: As you become more comfortable with using Zapier to automate your business workflows,
    you will find that in many situations, you may need more flexibility than what
    single-step workflows can offer. You will start to build more complex workflows,
    which will allow you to automate multiple action steps in your processes involving
    tasks in various apps. You may find that often, the data you need to use in subsequent
    actions is not available in the trigger and existing action steps. In these cases,
    you will need to know how to use search action events to retrieve data. To complement
    using triggers and actions, you may also want to customize your Zaps further by
    using the myriad of built-in tools that Zapier has created to allow you to transform
    and manipulate data, all from within the Zapier platform.

  zh: 随着您对使用 Zapier 自动化业务工作流程的熟悉程度增加，您会发现在许多情况下，您可能需要比单步工作流提供的更灵活的操作。您将开始构建更复杂的工作流程，这将允许您自动化涉及各种应用程序任务的多个操作步骤。您可能会经常发现所需用于后续操作的数据在触发器和现有动作步骤中不可用。在这些情况下，您将需要知道如何使用搜索动作事件来检索数据。为了补充使用触发器和动作，您可能还想通过使用
    Zapier 创建的各种内置工具来进一步定制您的 Zaps，以便您可以在 Zapier 平台内转换和操作数据。

    Workflow (Zap)*, we covered the basics of how to create a single-step Zap. In
    this chapter, we will build on the knowledge you have gained and discuss how to
    develop multi-step Zaps using multiple actions and searches and introduce you
    to the various built-in apps created by Zapier. We will begin by covering how
    to create multi-step Zaps by recapping using action steps and adding search steps.
    Then, we will explore how to delete, duplicate, reorder, and rename steps in Zaps.
    You will also be able to test your knowledge with an exercise involving a multi-step
    Zap. Then, we will briefly introduce the functionality of all the built-in apps
    by Zapier, all of which will be covered in detail in subsequent chapters.

    in words the usefulness of search action functionality. It gives the user the
    ability to extract information that you might not have available from the trigger
    steps or previous action steps. A common example would be when you make a sale

    the product to then use in other steps.

    explored how to name your Zaps adequately. The same logic can be applied to steps
    in your Zaps. As Zapier will automatically name the step based on the app and
    the trigger or action event involved, it’s useful to be able to change the name
    to make it more descriptive. This is especially important if you’re working with
    a team, to give more context to the purpose of the step, and if you have many
    steps in your Zap as you will be able to use keywords to search for steps in the
    **Outline** section rather than scrolling through your entire Zap.

    Zap 中的步骤。由于 Zapier 将根据所涉及的应用程序和触发器或操作事件自动命名步骤，因此更改名称以使其更具描述性是很有用的。如果您正在与团队一起工作，这尤其重要，以给步骤的目的提供更多的上下文，并且如果您的
    Zap 中有许多步骤，则能够使用关键字在**概览**部分中搜索步骤而不是滚动整个 Zap 将会很有用。
