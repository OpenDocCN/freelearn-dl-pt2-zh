- en: What if this book was written by artificial intelligence? Would you read it?
    I hope so because parts of it were. Yes, GPT-3 was used to create parts of this
    book. It's a bit meta I know, a book about GPT-3 written by GPT-3\. But creating
    content is one of the many great uses for GPT-3\. So why not? Also, for me, content
    generation was the use case that most piqued my interest. I wondered if GPT-3
    could be used in a product I was working on to automate the generation of technical
    learning material.

- en: You probably also have a specific reason why you're interested in GPT-3\. Perhaps
    it's intellectual curiosity. Or maybe you have an idea that you think GPT-3 can
    enable. You've likely seen online demos of GPT-3 generating content, writing code,
    penning poetry, or something else, and you're wondering if GPT-3 could be used
    for an idea you have. If so, this book was written specifically for you.

- en: My goal for this book is to provide a practical resource to help you get started
    with GPT-3, as quickly as possible, without any required technical background.
    That said, as I write this, GPT-3 is still in private beta. So, everyone is learning
    as they go. But the one thing I've learned for sure is that the possible applications
    for GPT-3 are vast and there is no way to know all of what's possible, let alone
    get it into a book. So, I hope this book makes getting started easy, but I also
    hope it's just the beginning of your journey *Exploring GPT-3*

- en: This book was written for anyone with an interest in NLP or learning GPT-3 â€“
    with or without a technical background. Developers, product managers, entrepreneurs,
    and hobbyists who want to learn about NLP, AI, and GPT-3 will find this book useful.
    Basic computer skills are all you need to get the most out of the book. While
    experience with a modern programming language is helpful, it's not required. The
    code examples provided are beginner friendly and easy to follow, even if you're
    brand new to writing code.

    Development Environment** (**IDE**) from [replit.com](http://replit.com). A free
    replit.com account is sufficient to follow the examples. To use replit.com, all
    that is required is a modern web browser and a replit.com account. The code has
    also been tested on macOS using Visual Studio Code, although it should work with
    any code editor and properly configured operating system. Code examples are provided
    in both Node.js/JavaScript and Python. For Node.js, version 12.16.1 is used and
    for Python, version 3.8.2 is used.
