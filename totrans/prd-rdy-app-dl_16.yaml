- en: The last phase of a **deep learning** (**DL**) project is the reviewing process.
    During the planning phase, the responsibility of each stakeholder has been defined
    and the goal of the project has been set. In this phase, stakeholders must group
    again to revisit the responsibilities and the goal to evaluate whether the project
    was carried out as planned or not. Such a process can be summarized as a **post-implementation
    review** (**PIR**). To guide the reviewing process further, we also describe different
    ways of evaluating a completed project, including but not limited to gap analysis,
    estimate at completion, and sustainability analysis. In addition to project evaluation,
    the details of the project need to be recorded and potential improvements must
    be discussed so that the next project can be achieved more efficiently.

    project was carried out. Throughout this process, you will compare the final state
    of the project against the goal state and organize the generated artifacts from
    the current project for reusability. Overall, this process should lead you to
    a broad understanding of the project’s success or failure. Furthermore, it will
    give you a clear indication of how future projects should be managed and how to
    avoid the mistakes made in the current project. Following this line of thought,
    you should have a bigger picture in mind all the time beyond the scope of the
    current project; one project might be completed, but the insights that you obtained
    will be reusable for future projects.'

    First, you need to revisit the due dates and estimated resource usage defined
    in the planning phase. These two factors should’ve affected the spending directly
    throughout the project. Even if your project goes beyond the allocated budget
    or timeline, the project can be considered successful if the return is greater
    than the resources put in. For a project, **return on investment** (**ROI**) can
    be calculated using a simple formula:'

    goals, and so on ([https://financesonline.com/10-project-management-success-metrics-to-measure-your-team-performance](https://financesonline.com/10-project-management-success-metrics-to-measure-your-team-performance/)).
    However, we would like to call out **estimate at completion** (**EAC**), the metric
    that can be used for every phase of the project. It is used to predict the total
    cost of the project. Comparing EAC against the initially estimated budget at completion,
    you will be able to review whether you are on track with the initial cost estimation.
    Along with EAC, it is recommended to track the expenses throughout the project
    and the cost variance for each activity. Overall, the findings from this process
    will help you to minimize expenses and increase profits.'
