- en: In this chapter, we’ll cover all the need-to-know information to enable you
    to start automating manual and repetitive tasks in your business. We will start
    by covering how to strategize and plan individual workflows before automating
    them. We will then dive into working through a step-by-step process of connecting
    your apps to Zapier, introduce the two versions of the Zap editor, and work through
    an example to help you create your first Zap from scratch. Then, we will show
    you how to edit your Zaps and switch between versions, and how you can access
    a wide range of pre-built or guided workflows created by Zapier to speed up your
    Zap-building process. We will explain the different field types you may see in
    your action steps, and how to use the correct data formats for their fields. We
    will conclude this chapter by delving into the best practices to ensure the continuous
    improvement of your processes.

- en: Your company does not have a complex sales process. You have two salespeople
    who are using **ActiveCampaign** to manage your sales pipeline. New deals are
    created in the pipeline when marketing leads hit a certain lead score from automated
    marketing campaign opens and link clicks. There are also members of your admin
    team that do not need access to ActiveCampaign but need to know a summary of specific
    details associated with these new deals. This information is manually added to
    a Google Sheets spreadsheet by the sales team after they have created the deal
    in ActiveCampaign. The admin team has identified that, on occasion, deals have
    not been added to the spreadsheet, and there are often transcription errors in
    the data. The sales team has mentioned that the process is time-consuming and
    error-prone, which increases with volume. You have already worked through all
    the steps in the previous sections to simplify this process, establish whether
    it can be automated, and assess whether ActiveCampaign and Google Sheets integrate
    with Zapier and in what way.

    plan to establish how often your workflow is likely to start. For example, if
    you are using the Free plan, the update time is every 15 minutes, which means
    that Zapier will look for new data in that trigger app every 15 minutes so that
    it can start your workflow. This was discussed in [*Chapter 1*](B18474_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014),

    the different apps. Often, the title of the data may be named differently from
    what you expect. These naming conventions are based on what title the API field
    is given in the app. Concerning the data table in *Figure 3**.6* and trigger data
    in *Figure 3**.15*, in our example, we may expect to see a value for `deal_title`
    instead, and for `contact_orgname` or `deal_orgname` instead. As you become more
    familiar with how field data is named and presented from your trigger and action
    steps, you can add an additional column to your data mapping table that shows
    the API field’s name.

    how to use Zapier. You can save time, however, by exploring and using pre-built
    templates or guided workflows called Zap templates. Zapier has created thousands
    of single-step Zaps using popular combinations of apps and corresponding trigger
    or action events. These Zap templates can be accessed from various locations,
    as we have mentioned throughout this chapter; however, the most practical place
    to start using guided workflows is from the main dashboard and using the **Make
    a Zap** interactive tool.

    or **Cancel** to start again. This is shown in the following screenshot, which

    approach by naming the objective. For example, you could choose a template to
    post new WordPress posts to your Facebook page, then follow the steps to connect
    your WordPress and Facebook Pages accounts, customize the Zap, test it, and publish
    it.
