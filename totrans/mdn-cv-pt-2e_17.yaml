- en: In the final section of this book, we will learn about merging computer vision
    techniques with techniques in other fields, such as **natural language processing**
    (**NLP**), reinforcement learning, and foundation models, to develop new ways
    of solving traditional problems with limited or no training data. Next, we will
    learn about novel image generation techniques like Stable Diffusion and will implement
    multiple applications. Finally, we will learn the best practices for moving a
    model to production.
