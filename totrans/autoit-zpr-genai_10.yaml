- en: Communicating with your team and clients is an integral part of running any
    business. Using the digital communication technology that we have available to
    us can only help make operations smoother and more productive. Most companies
    that exist today use email to communicate with their teams, customers, suppliers,
    and, on a personal level, with friends. Some companies will take things one step
    further and use mobile phone text messaging for marketing purposes or sending
    automated reminders for meetings, for example. There are many email messaging
    and text messaging apps available on the market, many of which integrate with
    Zapier, so that you can automate email and text messaging processes, some at a
    cost. You may, however, want to send simple messages by email or text, at no extra
    cost to you and in situations where you don’t need to retain history. This is
    where Zapier’s four built-in communication apps (**SMS**, **Email**, **IMAP**,
    and **SMTP**) come into play.
