- en: In this book we will explore *generative AI*, a cutting-edge technology for
    generating synthetic (yet strikingly realistic) data using advanced machine learning
    algorithms. Generative models have been intriguing researchers across domains
    for quite some time now. With recent improvements in the fields of machine learning
    and more specifically deep learning, generative modeling has seen a tremendous
    uptick in the number of research works and their applications across different
    areas. From artwork and music composition to synthetic medical datasets, generative
    modeling is pushing the boundaries of imagination and intelligence alike. The
    amount of thought and effort required to understand, implement, and utilize such
    methods is simply amazing. Some of the newer methods (such as GANs) are very powerful,
    yet difficult to control, making the overall learning process both exciting and
    frustrating.

- en: '*Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2* is the result of numerous hours
    of hard work by us authors and the talented team at *Packt Publishing* to help
    you understand this *deep*, *wide*, and *wild* space of generative modeling. The
    aim of this book is to be a kaleidoscope of the generative modeling space and
    cover a wide range of topics. This book takes you on a journey where you don''t
    just read the theory and learn about the fundamentals, but you also discover the
    potential and impact of these models through worked examples. We will implement
    these models using a variety of open-source technologies – the Python programming
    language, the TensorFlow 2 library for deep neural network development, and cloud
    computing resources such as Google Colab and the Kubeflow project.'

    concepts for deep neural networks that will be utilized in the rest of the volume
    – how they were inspired by biological research, what challenges researchers overcame
    in developing ever larger and more sophisticated models, and the various building
    blocks of network architectures, optimizers, and regularizers utilized by generative
    AI examples in the rest of the book.'

    a deep belief network, a breakthrough neural network architecture that achieved
    state-of-the-art results in classifying images of handwritten digits through a
    generative AI approach, which teaches the network to generate images before learning
    to classify them.'

    variational autoencoders (VAEs), an advancement from deep belief networks which
    create sharper images of complex objects through clever use of an objective function
    grounded in Bayesian statistics. The reader will implement both a basic and advanced
    VAE which utilizes inverse autoregressive flow (IAF), a recursive transformation
    that can map random numbers to complex data distributions to create striking synthetic
    images.'

    networks, or GANs, as powerful deep learning architectures for generative modeling.
    Starting with the building blocks of GANs and other fundamental concepts, this
    chapter covers a number of GAN architectures and how they are used to generate
    high resolution images from random noise.'
