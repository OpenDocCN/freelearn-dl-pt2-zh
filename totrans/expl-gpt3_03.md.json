The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek γαλακτικός κύκλος (galaktikos kýklos, \"milky circle\").[19][20][21] From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610\\. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe.[22] Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis,[23] observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies. The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with an estimated visible diameter of 150-200,000 light-years,[9][24][25] an increase from traditional estimates of 100,000 light-years. Recent simulations suggest that a dark matter disk, also containing some visible stars, may extend up to a diameter of almost 2 million light-years.[11][12] \nI rephrased this in plain language that a third grader could understand.\n```", "```py\nEnglish: I do not speak Spanish \nSpanish:\n```", "```py\nTwitter post: \"I think I nailed my interview today!\"\nSentiment (positive, neutral, negative): \n```", "```py\nComprehension Question: \"What is the best way to travel from New York to London?\"\nTravel Type (swim, drive, fly):\n```", "```py\nQ:\"I like Dalmatians\"\nA:Dog Lover\nQ:\"I like Tigers\"\nA:Cat Lover\nQ:\"I like Wolves\"\nA:Dog Lover\n```", "```py\nTweet: \"I loved the new Batman movie!\" \nSentiment: Positive \n### \nTweet: \"I hate it when my phone battery dies\" \nSentiment: Negative \n### \nTweet: \"My day has been great!\"\nSentiment: Positive \n### Tweet: \"This is the link to the article\" \nSentiment: Neutral \n### \nTweet text \n1\\. \"I loved the new Batman movie!\" \n2\\. \"I hate it when my phone battery dies\" \n3\\. \"My day has been great!\" \n4\\. \"This is the link to the article\" \n5\\. \"This new music video blew my mind\" \nTweet sentiment ratings: \n1\\.
