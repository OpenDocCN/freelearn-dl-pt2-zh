- en: Now that we’ve covered how to automate marketing processes with Zapier, the
    next important business function to explore is the sales cycle and how to automate
    its processes. Sales, of course, is one of the most important business functions.
    Once your marketing processes are working on autopilot to push new leads your
    way, you will need an efficient way of converting them into sales. No sales means
    no revenue, and a business without revenue will not survive long at all. Therefore,
    having a streamlined and automated sales process will most definitely help ensure
    business success.

    chime every time they received money from a sale. These days, it’s not likely
    that many businesses have these antique cash registers, but many business owners
    might imagine that “cha-ching” sound when they make a sale and secretly do a little
    jig. Sales are what keep the business going and pay the employees, suppliers,

    from and made sales of their products or services when customers walked through
    the door. Some customers knew what they wanted, and others needed more information
    or a bit of convincing. The sales personnel worked the room and attended to potential
    buyers while having to answer the telephone, deal with inquiries, and book appointments.
    Customer details might have been recorded on a paper registration form, in a book
    or a spreadsheet, or not at all. Contracts were written out by hand or typed out,
    requiring a signature in person.

    You might use Gravity Forms, Google Forms, JotForm, Typeform, or another form
    builder. These forms might be for the purpose of sending through an inquiry about
    the company’s services and products when embedded into the company website or
    for marketing purposes so that people can sign up for the company’s newsletter

- en: It’s common that you might receive an email notification when a form entry is
    made, but then it can be time-consuming and repetitive to process that data and
    add it to other systems. By automating the process, you can then add that form
    data to multiple tools in your app stack and kick off workflows accordingly. For
    example, when a new form entry has been made, you could notify your team with
    a Slack message, send an SMS to yourself, add the entry to Google Drive or Dropbox
    as a text tile, create a new issue in **Jira**, create a new contact and opportunity
    in **Close.io**, and more.

    form that you can embed into web pages so that you can collect data. With the
    Gravity Forms integration, you can trigger workflows when a form is submitted.
    You can combine this trigger with action events to add the form data to your CRM,
    add a new task to your project management app, or send an automated email with
    Gmail, for example. You can also create a form entry and, additionally, trigger
    rules associated with the form submission, such as notifications and feed add-ons.

    and, additionally, when a form response is modified. You can combine these triggers
    with action events to add or update data in your email marketing tool, such as
    **ConvertKit**, add events to Google Calendar, or send out an automated voicemail
    with Slybroadcast, for example. You can also create a new form response and row

    to get that revenue streaming in. Those appointments might be for free discovery
    or informative calls, charged consulting sessions, or other in-person services
    such as massages or therapy. The first step in improving your appointment booking
    and scheduling processes is to use either built-in booking functionality in your
    existing apps, such as with some CRMs such as Pipedrive, Dubsado, or HubSpot,
    or to use a dedicated scheduling app, such as Acuity Scheduling or Calendly. These
    apps allow you to create custom time slots that can be displayed on your website
    or shared using a URL. They integrate with your calendar so that your availability
    is displayed and events are automatically created in the calendar once a booking
    has been made. Some apps also allow you to take payments in advance. Once you’re
    using this functionality, you can then automate processes accordingly by creating
    workflows that include these apps.

    Scheduling或Calendly。这些应用程序允许你创建自定义时间段，可以在你的网站上显示或使用URL共享。它们与你的日历集成，所以你的可用性会显示出来，并且一旦预约成功，日历中就会自动创建事件。有些应用程序还允许你提前收款。一旦你使用了这些功能，你就可以根据需要创建包含这些应用程序的工作流程来自动化流程。

    are scheduled, canceled, or rescheduled, when appointments start, or when a new
    product order is completed. You can combine these triggers with action events

    so that they can manage their leads and customers. These tools quite often are
    the single source of truth about the contact and, therefore, hold all the information
    about the contact and communications with that contact. Most CRM apps allow you
    to classify contacts by the stage they are at in the buyer process, such as a
    lead, opportunity, or customer, and how warm a prospect they are based on their
    activities. You can create deals or opportunities to track your prospect’s progress
    through your sales cycle and create activities or tasks to help manage your touchpoints
    with the prospect. In some cases, you can connect your email account, then send
    and record email communications, connect your calendar, and schedule appointments
    directly from the CRM. Some CRMs have product modules enabling you to add products
    and pricing to your deals, and some allow you to manage support tickets and perform
    email marketing functions.

- en: Some businesses need to send client-facing documents such as proposals, quotes,
    or contracts. In some situations, these documents might need to be digitally signed
    by the client. Many businesses use a collection of tools to accomplish this, often
    involving manual processes of copying and pasting information into Microsoft Word
    or **PowerPoint** documents, or perhaps Google Docs or **Google Slides** documents.
    The documents are manually sent by email, and then, when a signature is required,
    customers often need to print, sign, and scan to sign the document or download
    software to use. We can make the whole process easier for ourselves and our clients
    by using digital proposal, quoting, and eSign tools, such as PandaDoc, **Proposify**,
    **HelloSign**, **DocuSign**, and **ZohoSign**, to streamline sales workflows.
    Users can create beautiful, branded templates, and as these tools quite often
    integrate with numerous CRM systems, they allow the user to create mail merge
    fields that pull required information into the new document, such as names, email
    addresses, addresses, and products, for example. Some apps also allow you to take

    manage their sales process from lead capture through sales cycle stages in pipelines
    to integrating with other tools to connect other business functions, such as calling
    and invoicing. Pipedrive is primarily built for B2B interactions but can be adapted
    to a B2C process. Pipedrive allows you to build forms to use standalone or to
    embed into your website so that you can automatically add new leads to the CRM.
    You can create and manage contacts in the form of people and associated organizations,
    and you can create leads and then convert qualified leads into deals to move them
    through your sales cycle in one or more pipelines. You can create activities or
    tasks set to certain dates and times to ensure that you and your sales team remember
    to work through various touchpoints to engage your prospects. You can connect
    your email account so that you can send and receive emails straight from within
    the platform and emails are logged against the contact and associated deals. You
    can also connect your calendar and schedule meetings. Pipedrive also has a products
    module, allowing you to create and manage line items with quantities and pricing
    that can be added to deals.

    structure with contacts, companies, tasks, and deal creation and updates; however,
    it has a much more comprehensive range of action events covering other module
    components, allowing for more flexibility in your automations. The Salesforce
    integration may have fewer actions; however, these generally are based on records
    being grouped together to allow the record type to be selected from a drop-down

- en: One of the most useful values that is used within searches, particularly in
    CRM integrations, is the record ID. For example, when searching for a contact,
    an email address is likely to be a unique value; however, there might be a slight
    possibility of duplicate contacts within a system. The most reliable value for
    retrieving a record is the unique ID associated with that record. When assessing
    what CRM might be appropriate for use in your business, one thing to consider
    is how robust the API is. A good reference point is whether the integration allows
    you to retrieve information based on record ID and what range of information you
    can retrieve.

    the *Understanding field data types* section in [*Chapter 3*](B18474_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor374),

    workflows, bear in mind that if you are mapping ID values, the name may vary between
    the steps. For example, in a trigger step of `id` is the note ID, `deal_id` is
    the ID of the associated deal, and `org_id` is the ID of the associated organization.
    If you then use an action step such as **Create Deal**, the resulting ID would
    be the deal ID.

- en: The Pipedrive integration does not have a specific trigger event that allows
    you to trigger a workflow when a field is updated, unlike the Salesforce **Updated
    Field on Record** trigger. A workaround for this involves using workflow automations
    in Pipedrive, which are only available on Advanced plans and higher, and filtered
    lists. You can create a workflow automation in Pipedrive that triggers a deal
    being updated, with a filter on one or more fields being changed, and an action
    to create an activity marked as complete that is used in a filtered list. In the
    list filter, the specific activity would be already done but due on that day.
    You can then combine this with the Zapier-Pipedrive **Activity Matching Filter**
    trigger event to trigger a workflow as appropriate.

    in your other apps that you have connected in workflows, and vice versa. For example,
    if your Zap involves Pipedrive and Google Sheets, add Pipedrive record IDs to
    columns in your Google Sheet and Google Sheet row IDs to custom fields in Pipedrive.
    This allows for more reliability than using search actions.
