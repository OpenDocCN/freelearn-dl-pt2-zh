    what **business process automation** (**BPA**) is and how it can make light work
    of manual and repetitive processes. We’ll cover how applications connect with
    others to transfer data and how Zapier has impacted the no-code revolution to
    automate tasks without the need for developers. This background information will
    put you in a better position to grasp the terms and concepts used by Zapier and
    will help you understand the features and functionality of Zapier, as well as
    how the platform works.

    business strives to make the most of its resources and improve productivity so
    that there is more time to increase revenue. Many companies have systems that
    may not communicate with each other, and as a result will have processes that
    are manual, time-consuming, and error-prone.

    work easier, and it is now more straightforward and cost-effective than ever to
    implement and run this technology ourselves. By introducing appropriate business
    technology tools, connecting those tools, and automating manual and repetitive
    tasks, businesses can significantly increase productivity. We’ll explore this

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: According to Zapier, “*Business process automation (BPA) is the practice of
    using software to automatically execute repetitive tasks related to a company’s
    essential procedures. You can use BPA to streamline and optimize processes for
    everything from sales and marketing to HR, compliance, training, and beyond.*”
    BPA is all about using technology to improve the way we work by automatically
    performing repetitive tasks that would typically require human intervention. It
    ultimately focuses on the human element in the process rather than the actual
    applications that are in use. Of course, the tools you use are fundamental and
    need to be the right ones for their jobs; however, the real goal is to help the
    people using those systems to be more productive and focus on the tasks that truly
    matter for the success and growth of an organization.

    platform users report time savings of a few hours a week by automating certain
    tasks such as social media posting, to more than 160 hours a month being saved
    by automating entire sales cycles or operation functions. The value of time savings
    is relative to the individual case. For example, a time saving of 2 or 3 hours
    a week may be of significant value to a solopreneur, whereas a 160-hours-per-month
    saving equates to having a full-time employee working for free. These savings
    in hours would translate to savings of thousands of dollars in resource time.

    to bear in mind that applying automation to an already inefficient operation will
    increase its inefficiency. As a whole, BPA requires you to take specific steps
    to look at your processes holistically, understand and simplify them, identify
    what systems can be connected, and only then decide on which tasks can benefit
    from automation. In [*Chapter 2*](B18474_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor225), *Preparing
    to Automate Your Processes*, we will work through the steps required to map out
    our business processes and streamline them by identifying what can be simplified,

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Allowing your business applications to communicate with one another and then
    automating tasks where possible is key to increasing productivity. Before we can
    explore how automation with Zapier comes into this picture, we need to understand
    how business applications can be connected using **API integrations**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An **application programming interface** (**API**) is a means by which a software
    program can communicate with another software program. It essentially allows data
    from different systems to pass between them when they are connected by some form
    of **middleware**. If you imagine two software programs having their own language
    in their API – for example, one French and one Spanish – the middleware acts as
    the translator between the two.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When two software programs are connected in this way through their APIs and
    middleware, they are said to be “integrated.” When an `The requested URL was not
    found on this server`, depicting a 404 error response. How API integration is
    created and customized defines what range of information can be requested.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the goal of API integration is to share data efficiently between two connected
    apps, there must be a way to identify changes in these resources. For example,
    if you want a new row to be created in your spreadsheet app when a new subscriber
    is added to your email marketing app, you need to know that the new contact has
    been created in the first place. At the time of writing, the two most popular
    methods for identifying changes are **polling endpoints** and **webhooks**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the polling method, requests for new events (for example, creating, retrieving,
    and deleting resources) are repeatedly sent at predefined intervals, waiting for
    a response. If there is no response, this signifies that there are no new events.
    So, in the preceding example, the polling method would periodically search for
    new occurrences of contact records being created, say every 15 minutes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With webhooks, however, instead of sending requests, you provide a URL that
    your originating app monitors for new events, thus receiving information in real
    time. So, in the preceding example, when a new contact record is created, the
    information would be provided instantly. Webhooks are an instant and much more
    efficient way of communicating event information. We will discuss webhooks in
    more detail in [*Chapter 11*](B18474_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor1426), *Advanced Built-In
    Apps* *by Zapier*.

- en: The options available for businesses to connect their tools
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Building API integrations requires software programming and development skills
    and can be a lengthy and costly process. Most applications that you are currently
    using for your business processes are likely to have a section on their website
    containing a list of the other applications with which they integrate natively.
    The applications listed in these app marketplaces, or **app ecosystems**, have
    integrations created using APIs to enable the two apps to communicate with each
    other. Software providers invest time, money, and technical skills into building
    and maintaining these **native integrations**. Generally, these providers will
    create an integration that satisfies the highest priority needs of most users
    to automate the most frequently used types of activities. They may also prioritize
    integration development resources on other more commonly used applications rather
    than smaller, less popular apps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some cases, a user of certain software might need to connect another tool
    that is not listed in the app ecosystem or may need to accomplish a specific task
    that is not available with the existing native integration. Under these circumstances,
    a business could employ a programmer to write **code** to create a **custom integration**
    with the API provided by the software provider. For most companies, the process
    of developing a custom integration is not a financially viable option. Therefore,
    there is often a reliance on what integrations are available in these app ecosystems
    and how flexible they are.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thankfully, as technology has developed, it is now possible to create digital
    processes without the need to write any code. Therefore, anyone can learn how
    to build a website, create email templates, and connect their systems using, in
    many cases, visual drag-and-drop editors. These editors give you the ability to
    add and remove visual blocks in templates rather than writing code in a computer
    programming language. Instead of needing to use a developer to write this code,
    the average person with basic IT skills can create these processes themselves.
    These advances are described as a **no-code revolution**, as software providers
    have pushed forward to develop solutions that will help the non-IT workforce to
    execute tasks that could previously only be done by software engineers.

    manage your business processes without writing code. Zapier essentially acts as
    a connector or translator between thousands of cloud-based applications that may
    not have native integrations with each other or for which the event requests are
    more limited, allowing them to communicate with each other. The platform enables
    users to build business-specific workflow automation with a visual editor using
    pre-built integrations to seamlessly perform manual and repetitive tasks without
    human intervention.

    and Mike Knoop. They recognized the productivity struggles that plague small-
    and medium-sized businesses, where many repetitive tasks are handled manually
    and with an ever-increasing chance of errors occurring. They developed a powerful
    solution to help businesses with their efficiency struggles, allowing them to
    connect their web applications and automate their mundane and repetitive tasks
    using custom-built workflows. Most importantly, the solution allows the average
    business owner and their team to use the software without the need for writing
    code. The first release of the Zapier platform was in 2012, and since then, they
    have grown their integration marketplace to over 5,000 app connections. Zapier
    is based in California, USA, and as a company that actively supports an ethos
    of remote working, they have grown their global team to over 600 people located
    in the US and over 20 other countries around the world.

    thousands of different apps In essence, the Zapier user then becomes the developer
    without needing to use code. Using no-code technology, we no longer need advanced
    technical skills to harness the power of **integration automation**.

    completes. Your Zapier pricing plan defines your monthly task limit. Completed
    actions, searches, and passed filters all count as a task, which, in turn, count
    toward your monthly task limit. For example, if you have a single-step Zap with
    one action and the Zap triggers five times in one day, your task count would be
    five. If, however, you have a multi-step Zap that has three actions and it triggers
    five times in one day, your task count would be 15.

    according to the number of tasks you have available monthly, the number of Zaps
    you can set up, and how short the syncing interval is. On most plans (except for
    the Free plan), you can retain features and add additional tasks for an extra
    fee. The availability of Zap history data and access to online customer service

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Zapier is ideal for any size business that wants to automate its processes.
    It can be used by solopreneurs or companies with small or large teams. It can
    also be used by freelancers and consultants to manage their clients’ processes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The needs of your business will determine which price plan is best to use. How
    many processes you would like to automate and how complex these processes are
    will impact your decision.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Free plan
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For businesses with one user that only have a few simple tasks to automate,
    this plan is the most appropriate. You will be able to build up to five single-step
    workflows using the majority of the apps that Zapier integrates with (excluding
    premium apps). Zapier will search for new data in your trigger apps every 15 minutes
    and run your Zaps, allowing up to 100 tasks per month to be processed. The Free
    plan is the best plan to get started with while you get to grips with how Zapier
    works at a basic level. You will also get access to standard features, such as
    creating your Zaps in draft, copying and pasting steps, and duplicating and reordering
    steps. You will also be able to organize your Zaps into folders and subfolders.
  prefs: []

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you still only have one user and a relatively small number of processes to
    automate, but you need to automate multiple activities in one or more apps (including
    up to three premium apps), try the Starter plan. You can take advantage of additional
    features, such as using conditions in filters, formatting text, numbers, and dates,
    accessing version history, as well as creating custom integrations with webhooks.
    You can build up to 20 Zaps and will have access to 750 tasks per month (1,500
    for a higher subscription payment). The update time remains at 15 minutes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Professional plan
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Professional plan is for single users that want to level up and use Zapier
    optimally. This plan is best for you if you have a large number of complex, multi-step
    processes that require conditional logic and you use more than three premium apps
    in your business. All Starter plan features are included, as well as the ability
    to create, duplicate, and reorder paths, use Autoreplay, create custom error notifications,
    and roll back to previous versions of your Zaps. You can take advantage of unlimited
    premium apps, unlimited Zaps, a quicker update time of two minutes, and access
    to between 2,000 and 2,000,000 tasks per month (depending on your subscription
    payment).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Businesses with two or more team members that are responsible for automating
    and managing processes should take advantage of the features available with the
    Team plan. All the elements of the Professional plan are included, with the added
    benefits of a faster update time of one minute, and you will be able to export
    Zaps and access audit logs. The Team plan allows teams to collaborate and automate
    their processes securely and in an organized way. Team members can securely access
    multiple apps without the need to share passwords and **API keys** between them,
    share workspaces, and select who has access to specific folders and apps. An additional
    bonus of this plan is access to a premier support team with faster, prioritized
    responses.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Company plan is for organizations that require enterprise-grade security
    considerations and want to separate their users into teams. You still have access
    to all the features of the Team plan, plus access to multiple workspaces, per-Zap
    Autoreplay, and the ability to adjust error ratio settings. Security features
    include user management, app access control, secure **single sign-on** (**SSO**),
    and top-level account management.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An additional bonus of this plan is the ability to customize Zap history data
    retention for shorter periods than the standard 30 days available on other plans
    to fit with your company’s regulatory requirements, as well as real-time support
    via live chat.

- en: In this chapter, we started with an overview of the principles of BPA and how
    we can use it to increase productivity. We discussed how applications integrate
    using APIs and transfer data between them. We then introduced Zapier, a no-code
    tool that integrates with thousands of business apps to help you automate tasks
    without the need for developers. We presented the key terms used on the Zapier
    platform and covered how to choose the right pricing plan for your business needs.
    Then, we discussed how to set up a Zapier account and familiarize yourself with
    navigating the platform. Lastly, we covered how to customize the various available
    settings.

    and plan a workflow in preparation for building a Zap and how to explore Zapier’s
    ecosystem of app integrations and use its features.
