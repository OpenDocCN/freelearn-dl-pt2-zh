    your Zapier account. As you build more Zaps, keeping them all organized will become
    more of a priority for preserving structure. We will, therefore, start this chapter
    by explaining how to keep your workflows organized in the Zap management area
    by using the best naming conventions and by using folders. We will then discuss
    how to manage individual Zaps and utilize the Zap **Settings** area. Next, we
    will help you to understand Zap statuses and then cover how best to manage your
    connected apps. Finally, we will discuss how to share your workflows with other
    Zapier users.

    Workflow (Zap)*, we worked through the steps required to create your first workflow
    automation. As you repeat that process, you will build more Zaps to automate your
    other business processes. It will eventually become more of a priority to ensure
    that you have created a system for organizing your workflows. It is, therefore,
    a good practice to understand how best to keep your Zaps organized and start this
    process when you only have a few workflows built.

    information to ensure a title is descriptive enough to understand what the Zap
    does. Labeling your Zaps in the right way will allow you to sort them into groups,
    search for them, and quickly identify them in the **Zap history** and when troubleshooting
    errors.

    this will come down to what seems most logical for your business and also personal

    steps when an event is triggered in the trigger app. In [*Chapter 3*](B18474_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor374),
    *Building Your First Automated Workflow (Zap)*, we used a working example to illustrate
    the Zap building process. In our example, we built a workflow that triggers when
    a new deal is created in ActiveCampaign, which then results in a row being added
    to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. We chose to name that Zap `Create new Google Sheets
    row when new deal is created in ActiveCampaign`. If your Zap triggered on a new
    contact being added to `Create new item in monday.com when new contact is added`
    `to SendinBlue`.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may also choose to specify a unique identifier, such as a user, a file,
    or an app account that is involved in either your trigger or action step(s) if
    highlighting this is of particular importance. For example, if you have multiple
    Zaps that accomplish a similar outcome but trigger based on different conditions,
    such as something user-specific, you could add the user’s name to the title to
    help you identify the difference between those workflows. In our example, we may
    choose to highlight the Google Sheets spreadsheet we are using and name the Zap
    `Create new Google Sheets (Our Deals) row when new deal is created` `in ActiveCampaign`.

- en: As you start to build multi-step Zaps, naming your Zaps using this method could
    get complex. Don’t overcomplicate the naming process. Abbreviate where possible,
    use keywords, and keep your Zap titles short yet descriptive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Zaps based on keywords.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Adding numbers, letters, or Roman numerals
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another frequently used Zap naming method is to add numbers, letters, Roman
    numerals, or a suitable combination preceding the short trigger/action description.
    In our example, we may choose to number and name the Zap `1a. Create new Google
    Sheets (Our Deals) row when new deal is created in ActiveCampaign`. This method
    is especially useful if you have split your workflows so that they mirror steps
    in the actual processes you are automating. As Zaps are listed alphanumerically
    in the Zap management area, naming your Zaps in this way is also helpful if you
    want to see your Zaps in a particular order. Numbering your Zaps will also help
    for quick reference purposes when looking at Zap history information.
