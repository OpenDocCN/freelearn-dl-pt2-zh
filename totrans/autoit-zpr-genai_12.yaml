    compile data. In this chapter, we will continue looking at more built-in functionality
    that Zapier has to offer with its range of built-in apps. We will cover descriptions

    Push by Zapier) to initiate one-off automation from any page on the internet,
    and how to shorten URLs with URL Shortener by Zapier. Then, we will discuss how
    to translate text from different languages using Translate by Zapier, and how
    to score lead information using Lead Score by Zapier. Lastly, we will cover how
    to use data on weather conditions using Weather by Zapier, and how to use astrological
    predictions using Retrograde by Zapier.

    the web about a contact and their associated company using their email address.
    The search also produces a customer fit qualification score based on various data
    points. The app uses data from [MadKudu.com](https://MadKudu.com), a data enrichment
    service, which, as a standalone service, can be quite pricey for small businesses
    and start-ups. With the Lead Score by Zapier app, you can perform up to 500 free
    searches per month using this service. However, if you’re likely to need a higher
    number of searches, you can sign up for a paid plan at [MadKudu.com](http://MadKudu.com)
    and use the Zapier-**MadKudu** integration instead of Lead Score by Zapier.

    make better decisions on which leads to follow up with first and understand your
    contacts better. This will allow you to create more applicable communications
    and better experiences for your leads and customers. Lead Score by Zapier saves
    you the hassle of manually searching for this data and can give you access to

    company search data, such as in Salesforce or **HubSpot**.

    and chosen **Retrograde by Zapier** as the app and either **Mercury enters Retrograde**,
    **Mercury in Retrograde**, or **Mercury leaves Retrograde** as the trigger event,
    you can select **Continue**. As there are no fields to edit, in the **Test** section,
    use the **Test trigger** button to retrieve your test data so that you can use
    it in your action steps.

    specific functions, such as how to use the Zapier Chrome extension to initiate
    a one-off automation from any page on the internet, how to shorten URLs with URL
    Shortener by Zapier, and how to translate and detect text from different languages
    using Translate by Zapier. We also discussed how to retrieve and score lead information
    using Lead Score by Zapier, how to use data on weather conditions using Weather
    by Zapier, and how to use astrological predictions using Retrograde by Zapier
    in your automations.
