    flat surfaces. As kindergarten children, we played on flat playgrounds. In elementary
    school, we sat in flat classrooms. Then, our parents and teachers told us that
    the Earth was round and that the people on the other side of it were upside down.
    It took us quite a while to understand why they did not fall off the Earth. Even
    today, when we see a beautiful sunset, we still see the “sun set,” and not the
    Earth rotating away from the sun!
