    flat surfaces. As kindergarten children, we played on flat playgrounds. In elementary
    school, we sat in flat classrooms. Then, our parents and teachers told us that
    the Earth was round and that the people on the other side of it were upside down.
    It took us quite a while to understand why they did not fall off the Earth. Even
    today, when we see a beautiful sunset, we still see the “sun set,” and not the
    Earth rotating away from the sun!

    to find key information in Tweets, Facebook messages, and other media.

    a rationale for teachers, parents, friends, co-workers, or just people talking.
    We added classical software functions to help us on the way.

    We will analyze how a transformer gradually builds a representation of a sequence
    in the next chapter, *Interpreting Black Box Transformer Models*.
