- en: So far, we’ve covered how to automate three essential business functions, namely,
    marketing, sales, and operations. Having efficient processes in those three areas
    directly impacts your finance processes as more leads are converted into sales,
    which are then smoothly served, which means that there are more accounting transactions
    to handle. Automating your finance processes, therefore, means that as you scale,
    you can handle larger volumes of transactions quicker and more accurately, thereby
    giving you access to real-time financial performance data.

  zh: 到目前为止，我们已经介绍了如何自动化三个关键的业务功能，即营销、销售和运营。这三个领域的高效流程直接影响您的财务流程，因为更多的潜在客户转化为销售，然后顺利地提供服务，这意味着有更多的会计交易需要处理。因此，自动化您的财务流程意味着随着业务规模的扩大，您可以更快、更准确地处理更大量的交易，从而让您能够获得实时的财务绩效数据。
- en: Once you’ve got a better handle on your accounting processes, you can focus
    on getting better visibility of the higher-quality data coming from all aspects
    of your business by automating reporting processes. Having access to this up-to-date
    and accurate data allows you to proactively gain insights into business performance
    when you need to, without much manual intervention. You can easily produce management
    reports for key stakeholders and analyze the business for weaknesses and opportunities
    for improvement.

    up to date. In fact, bookkeeping is one of the tasks that many business owners
    leave to the last minute if they don’t have a dedicated bookkeeper or accounting
    team. We would like to think that most businesses are now completely paperless
    in their approach to keeping their finances under control; however, sometimes,
    you can’t avoid having paper copies of purchases and expenses. And even when a
    business can move to a completely digital accounting management system by receiving
    all purchase invoices from suppliers by email, using expense management tools
    that allow you to take photographs of your expenses and purchases, and creating
    digital sales invoices and sending them to customers by email, the process of
    recording all of this data in one place can still be a manual, repetitive, time-consuming,
    and extremely error-prone process.

    invoices – all this alongside attaching copies of the original transaction, if
    required. Improving these processes ultimately increases the efficiency and accuracy
    of real-time financial reporting.

    and expense transactions, such as when you buy lunch at a restaurant for your
    clients or when your sales teams travel and incur hotel and subsistence costs
    and collect receipts. You can automate the creation of these purchase invoices
    and expenses in your accounting app by automatically forwarding emails with attachments
    to **Optical Character Recognition** (**OCR**) apps such as **Dext** (previously
    called **ReceiptBank**) and **Hubdoc**. These OCR apps transcribe the details
    on the invoices and push the data straight into accounting apps such as Xero and
    QuickBooks Online.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dext has an integration with Zapier, allowing you to trigger workflows when
    processed receipt data is available, receipt data is ready for export, and processed
    receipt notifications occur. You can combine these triggers with action events
    to create new invoices or bills in your accounting software or add the information
    to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. You can also submit receipts or sales invoices,
    check the number of process receipts, and create a new client account if you’re
    using a partner account. You can combine these actions with triggers such as new
    files being added to Google Drive or Box or new emails with attachments being
    received. Alternatively, if you are using an OCR app such as Hubdoc that doesn’t
    have a Zapier integration, you can use the Gmail or Microsoft Outlook Zapier integrations
    with the **New Labeled Email** or **New Email** trigger events, respectively,
    to forward emails with an attachment to an email address linked to the OCR app.

    can trigger workflows when a new report is created. You can combine this trigger
    with action events to add or create purchase invoices for contractors in Xero
    or Quickbooks Online, or email copies of expense reports to a manager. You can
    also create a single expense item, create an expense report, export a report to
    PDF, and find a report. Combine these actions with triggers to create expense
    items from new Dropbox files or Google Sheets spreadsheet rows.

    Quickbooks Online, Freshbooks Classic, or Zoho Books to manage all of your accounts
    payable and receivable processes in one place, you can use Zapier to automate
    a large number of finance processes and then streamline other business processes
    that involve them. Each of these apps integrates with Zapier and offers many trigger,
    action, and search action events. The Zapier integrations with accounting apps
    generally have line-item support, allowing you to create multiple rows of data
    in sales invoices, bills, and expenses.

    account, customer, estimate, invoice, sales receipt, payment, vendor, bill, or
    purchase order is added, a new payment is received, or when a customer record
    is updated. You can combine these triggers with action events to add new rows
    to a Microsoft Excel sheet, create new orders in ShipStation, or update a deal
    or opportunity in your CRM, for example. You can also create a new customer, estimate,
    invoice, sales receipt, refund receipt, credit memo, product or service, payment,
    vendor, bill, time activity, or purchase order, send an invoice or sales receipt,
    and update a customer or invoice. Combine these actions with triggers to create
    invoices and payments when new payments are confirmed in Stripe or Paypal, or
    to create new customers when form entries are submitted in Gravity Forms or **Wufoo**.
    You can also search for or create a customer or vendor, and you can find an account,
    invoice, product, or group of products.

    invoices in your invoicing or accounting apps. Having accurate records of your
    sales is extremely important to any business, but what might be even more important
    is making sure that you’re being paid as quickly as possible for your sales. Using
    online payment solutions to automatically take payments for invoices or allow
    customers to pay those invoices without having to do a bank transfer improves
    invoice payment times and cash flow in the business. Stripe and Paypal are two
    of the most popular online payment solutions that integrate with many invoicing
    and e-commerce apps.

    in Slack or in Microsoft Outlook, update contacts in Mailchimp, or add tasks to
    Asana. You can also create a customer, coupon, and product price point and create
    or update a subscription. You can combine these actions with triggers so that
    you can create new subscriptions when a row is updated in Smartsheet or new contacts
    are added to Salesforce. You can add search actions to find a product, product
    family, or component, and, optionally, create a subscription or customer if one

    operations, and finance processes, it’s crucial to understand how all of these
    key areas perform against key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics. Businesses
    can only make good decisions if they have up-to-date and accurate reporting information
    to hand. If this information is available instantly, you won’t have to spend hours
    downloading and manipulating data to present it to key decision-makers; they will

    bar graphs and charts to visualize business performance data. Spreadsheet tools
    have become advanced reporting tools in themselves, allowing complex calculations
    and data manipulation. Many of the apps that we use for various business functions
    have their own reporting modules. which enable businesses to extract useful reports
    and visualize reporting data internally. The issue businesses then have is that
    their reporting exists in multiple systems and tools and still needs to be collated
    and condensed so that you have fewer places to log in to and view your important
    reporting data. Automation using tools such as Zapier can help you to get your
    key data into the right places for enhancing your reporting and metric visualization
    processes.

    Google Sheets, and Smartsheet in your various operations processes. These tools
    are widely used for recording and manipulating numerical data with simple or complex
    formulas, which can then be used for visual reporting in graphs and tables. You
    can also use add-ons with Google Sheets to extract data from other sources such
    as Google Analytics or integrate Google Sheets with dashboard tools such as Infogram

    in creating a website and promoting their products, services, and reputation by
    pushing traffic from various sources to their website. As we discussed in [*Chapter
    20*](B18474_20.xhtml#_idTextAnchor2242), *Automating Your Marketing Processes*,
    businesses can use several methods to push traffic to their website, which could
    include paid ads, guest blog posting, and social media marketing. They also try
    to improve their online visibility in searches with **Search Engine Optimization**
    (**SEO**). With all this happening, a business needs to have a way to see the
    results of its marketing efforts at a glance, and both Google Analytics, an industry-standard
    tool for analyzing and visualizing website traffic, and **Hotjar**, an app that
    allows you to analyze your website traffic data, are examples of apps that enable
    you to do so. By using tools such as these, you will have better insights into
    your website visitors, such as their sources and geographical locations, and understand
    behaviors such as how long they spend on your website and on which pages. Then,
    by using automation tools such as Zapier, you can boost your productivity by automating
    your reporting processes, such as scheduling reports to run at a specific time
    each week and delivering the report by email, and tracking offline conversions
    for completed calls from your calling app, Twilio.

    various apps on one dashboard or on a few key dashboards, but all in one place
    where the data is refreshed automatically? That’s where business intelligence
    and dashboard tools come in. These apps allow you to collate all your important
    reporting data in one place, create KPIs to measure your collected data against,
    and represent this data in graphical forms that suit your needs. Many of these
    tools have integrations with popular apps such as Facebook and Salesforce, but
    often, integrations don’t exist. Automation tools such as Zapier increase the
    efficiency of your reporting processes by extracting key segments of data and
    pushing the exact data you want to change metrics in these dashboard tools. This
    is especially handy if integrations don’t exist between your apps and the chosen
    dashboard tool. **Databox**, **Geckoboard**, **Klipfolio**, **Dasheroo**, and
    **Zoho Analytics** are examples of business intelligence and dashboard reporting
    tools that integrate with Zapier.

    data in a data source, and refresh a data source. You can combine these action
    events with triggers involving other apps, allowing you to update insights without
    you having to manually import data. You could track the growth of a specific segment
    of your subscriber list in Klaviyo or Autopilot, or track unsubscribes and campaign
    clicks in ActiveCampaign. You could also monitor Twitter follower numbers, SurveyMonkey
    responses, Toky calls, or closed Asana tasks.

- en: Xero is a popular cloud-based accounting package used by small- and medium-sized
    businesses. With Xero, you can manage your accounts payable and accounts receivable
    processes, as well as manage expense claims and payroll and track inventory projects.
    You can create and send quotes, sales invoices, and purchase orders, and you can
    comprehensively report on your financials. You can also connect payment processing
    solutions such as PayPal, **GoCardless**, and **Stripe** to help you get paid
    faster by your customers. The ability to connect bank feeds to Xero automates
    part of the transaction reconciliation process, removing the need to manually
    import bank statements and transaction line entries. Depending on your location,
    you can submit tax returns and pay bills straight from Xero. Xero also allows
    you to handle multiple currencies.

    other parts of your business to your finance system. You can, however, use the
    Zapier integration to add power to your processes by connecting Xero to thousands
    of other apps so that you can automate many parts of your accounting processes.
    The Xero integration is very comprehensive and currently supports several trigger,
    action, and search events. A full list can be found on the Xero app profile page

    card is linked to. In this scenario, we want all European customer locations to
    have `OUTPUT2`) and all other countries to have `NONE`). Your tax settings differ
    based on your Xero region. We will use the Formatter by Zapier app with the `Payment
    Method Details Card Country`, and the `OUTPUT2`) on the right. We will set `NONE`
    for all other countries.
