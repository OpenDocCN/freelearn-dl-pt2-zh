- en: Machine learning is fast becoming the preferred way to solve data problems,
    thanks to the huge variety of mathematical algorithms that find patterns otherwise
    invisible to us.

- en: '*Applied Deep Learning with PyTorch* takes your understanding of deep learning,
    its algorithms, and its applications to a higher level. The book begins by helping
    you browse through the basics of deep learning and PyTorch. Once you are well
    versed with the PyTorch syntax and capable of building a single-layer neural network,
    you will gradually learn to tackle more complex data problems by configuring and
    training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform image classification.
    As you progress through the chapters, you''ll discover how you can solve an NLP
    problem by implementing a recurrent neural network (RNN).'

    gathered along your learning process to use PyTorch for building deep learning
    solutions that can solve your business data problems.

    and solving real-life problems after graduating from college as a business administrator.
    Since then, as a self-taught person, she not only works as a machine learning
    freelancer for many companies globally, but has also founded an artificial intelligence
    company that aims to optimize everyday processes. She has also authored *Machine
    Learning Fundamentals*, by Packt Publishing.'

    analysts, and developers who want to work with data using deep learning techniques.
    Anyone looking to explore and implement advanced algorithms with PyTorch will
    also find this book useful. Some working knowledge of Python and familiarity with
    the basics of machine learning are a must. However, knowledge of NumPy and pandas
    will be beneficial, but not essential.'
