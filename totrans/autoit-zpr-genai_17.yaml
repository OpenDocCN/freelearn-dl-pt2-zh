    that you need it in. You may often find that you need to change the format of
    that data so that it can be viewed in a certain way or it is compatible with the
    data formats required by your other apps. For example, say a new subscriber joins
    your newsletter but they have entered their name in lowercase; perhaps you may
    want to capitalize the first letter. Alternatively, a date might be shown in an
    American format but you might want to change it to an internationally recognized
    format instead. You may also want to strip out text that is presented in HTML
    format or use a spreadsheet-type formula to calculate something. All of this and
    more is possible to achieve without using code, by using Zapier’s extremely versatile
    Formatter by Zapier built-in app to manipulate a huge array of values into formats
    you prefer or need for a specific purpose.

- en: In this chapter, we will first introduce the Formatter by Zapier built-in app,
    with its range of functionality for manipulating dates and times, numbers, text,
    and various other values. With a primary focus on formatting dates and times,
    we will cover the basics of how to adjust date and time values in your Zaps. Then,
    we will discuss how to use the date and time your Zap runs in the rest of your
    action steps in the Zap. After that, we will explore how to use the Formatter
    by Zapier built-in app to add and subtract time and compare dates before diving
    into formatting date and time values using this built-in app.

    app so that you can manipulate dates and times, numbers, text, and other types
    of data. Thereafter, the primary focus of the content in this chapter was manipulating
    dates and times. We covered the basics of how to adjust date and time values in
    your Zaps. After that, we discussed how to use the date and time that your Zap
    runs in your action steps. Then, we explored how to use the Formatter by Zapier
    built-in app to add and subtract time and compare two dates. Lastly, we discussed
    how to format date and time values using the Formatter by Zapier built-in app.
