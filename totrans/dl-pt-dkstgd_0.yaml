- en: PyTorch is surprisingly easy to learn and provides advanced features such as
    a supporting multiprocessor, as well as distributed and parallel computation.
    PyTorch has a library of pre-trained models, providing out-of-the-box solutions
    for image classification. PyTorch offers one of the most accessible entry points
    into cutting-edge deep learning. It is tightly integrated with the Python programming
    language, so for Python programmers, coding it seems natural and intuitive. The
    unique, dynamic way of treating computational graphs means that PyTorch is both
    efficient and flexible.

- en: This book is for anyone who wants a straightforward, practical introduction
    to deep learning using PyTorch. The aim is to give you an understanding of deep
    learning models by direct experimentation. This book is perfect for those who
    are familiar with Python, know some machine learning basics, and are looking for
    a way to productively develop their skills. The book will focus on the most important
    features and give practical examples. It assumes you have a working knowledge
    of Python and are familiar with the relevant mathematical ideas, including with
    linear algebra and differential calculus. The book provides enough theory to get
    you up and running without requiring rigorous mathematical understanding. By the
    end of the book, you will have a practical knowledge of deep learning systems
    and able to apply PyTorch models to solve the problems that you care about.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book does not assume any specialist knowledge, only solid general computer
    skills. Python is a relatively easy (and incredibly useful!) language to learn,
    so don't worry if you have limited or no programming background.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book does contain some relatively simple mathematics, and some theory, that
    some readers may find difficult at first. Deep learning models are complex systems
    and understanding the behavior of even simple neural networks is a non-trivial
    exercise. Fortunately, PyTorch acts as a high-level framework around these complicated
    systems, so it is possible to achieve very good results without an expert understanding
    of the theoretical foundations.

    the Anaconda distribution of Python, and PyTorch itself. The software runs on
    Windows 7 and 10 , macOS 10.10 or above, and most versions of Linux. It can be
    run on a desktop machine or in a server environment. All the code in this book
    was tested using PyTorch version 1.0 and Python 3, running on Ubuntu 16.'
