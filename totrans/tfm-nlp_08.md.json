In the state of Montana, a corporation has all the powers of a natural person for carrying out its business activities.  The corporation can sue and be sued in its corporate name.  It has perpetual succession.  The corporation can buy, sell or otherwise acquire an interest in a real or personal property.  It can conduct business, carry on operations, and have offices and exercise the powers in a state, territory or district in possession of the U.S., or in a foreign country.  It can appoint officers and agents of the corporation for various duties and fix their compensation.\nThe name of a corporation must contain the word \"corporation\" or its abbreviation \"corp.\"  The name of a corporation should not be deceptively similar to the name of another corporation incorporated in the same state.  It should not be deceptively identical to the fictitious name adopted by a foreign corporation having business transactions in the state.\nThe corporation is formed by one or more natural persons by executing and filing articles of incorporation to the secretary of state of filing.  The qualifications for directors are fixed either by articles of incorporation or bylaws.  The names and addresses of the initial directors and purpose of incorporation should be set forth in the articles of incorporation.  The articles of incorporation should contain the corporate name, the number of shares authorized to issue, a brief statement of the character of business carried out by the corporation, the names and addresses of the directors until successors are elected, and name and addresses of incorporators.  The shareholders have the power to change the size of board of directors.\n\"\"\"\nprint(\"Number of characters:\",len(text))\nsummary=summarize(text,50)\nprint (\"\\n\\nSummarized text: \\n\",summary) \n```", "```py\nNumber of characters: 1816\nPreprocessed and prepared text: \n summarize: The law regarding the corporation prescribes that a corporation...\nSummarized text: \n a corporations can be incorporated in the state of Montana to serve any lawful purpose. a corporation can sue and be sued in its corporate name, and it has perpetual succession. it can conduct business, carry on operations and have offices \n```"]
