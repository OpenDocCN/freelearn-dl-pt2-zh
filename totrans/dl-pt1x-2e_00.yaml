- en: PyTorch is grabbing the attention of deep learning researchers and data science
    professionals due to its accessibility, efficiency, and the fact of it being more
    native to the Python way of development. This book will get you up and running
    with one of the most cutting-edge deep learning libraries—PyTorch.

- en: In this second edition, you'll learn about the various fundamental building
    blocks that power modern deep learning using the new features and offerings of
    the PyTorch 1.x library. You will learn how to solve real-world problems using
    **convolutional neural networks** (**CNNs**), **recurrent neural networks** (**RNNs**),
    and **long short-term memory** (**LSTM**) networks. You will then get to grips
    with the concepts of various state-of-the-art modern deep learning architectures,
    such as ResNet, DenseNet, and Inception. You will learn how to apply neural networks
    to various domains, such as computer vision, **natural language processing** (**NLP**),
    and more. You will see how to build, train, and scale a model with PyTorch and
    dive into complex neural networks such as generative networks and autoencoders
    for producing text and images. Furthermore, you will learn about GPU computing
    and how GPUs can be used to perform heavy computations. Lastly, you will learn
    how to work with deep learning-based architectures for transfer learning and reinforcement
    learning problems.
