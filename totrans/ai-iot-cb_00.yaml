- en: '**Artificial intelligence** (**AI**) is rapidly finding practical applications
    across a wide variety of industry verticals, and the **Internet of Things** (**IoT**)
    is one of them. Developers are looking for ways to make IoT devices smarter and
    to make users'' lives easier. With this AI cookbook, you''ll learn how to implement
    smart analytics using IoT data to gain insights, predict outcomes, and make informed
    decisions, along with covering advanced AI techniques that facilitate analytics
    and learning in various IoT applications.'

- en: Using a recipe-based approach, the book will take you through essential processes
    such as data collection, data analysis, modeling, statistics and monitoring, and
    deployment. You'll use real-life datasets from smart homes, industrial IoT, and
    smart devices to train and evaluate simple and complex models and make predictions
    using trained models. Later chapters will take you through the key challenges
    faced while implementing machine learning, deep learning, and other AI techniques
    such as **natural language processing** (**NLP**), computer vision, and embedded
    machine learning to build smart IoT systems. In addition to this, you'll learn
    how to deploy models and improve their performance with ease.

- en: If you're an IoT practitioner looking to incorporate AI techniques to build
    smart IoT solutions without having to trawl through a lot of AI theory, this AI
    IoT book is for you. Data scientists and AI developers who want to build IoT-focused
    AI solutions will also find this book useful. Knowledge of the Python programming
    language and basic IoT concepts is required to grasp the concepts covered in this
    AI book effectively.

    and AI Environment*, will focus on getting the right environment set up for success.
    You will learn how to choose a device that meets your needs for AI, whether that
    model needs to be on the edge or in the cloud. You will also learn how to securely
    communicate with modules within a device, other devices, or the cloud. Finally,
    you will set up a way to ingest data in the cloud and then set up Spark and AI
    tools to perform analysis of data, train models, and run machine learning models
    at scale.'
