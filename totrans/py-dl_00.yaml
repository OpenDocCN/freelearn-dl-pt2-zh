- en: With an increasing interest in AI around the world, deep learning has attracted
    a great deal of public attention. Every day, deep-learning algorithms are used
    broadly across different industries. This book will give you all the practical
    information available on the subject, including best practices, using real-world
    use cases. You will learn to recognize and extract information to increase predictive
    accuracy and optimize results.

- en: Starting with a quick recap of important machine learning concepts, the book
    will delve straight into deep learning principles using scikit-learn. Moving ahead,
    you will learn to use the latest open source libraries, such as Theano, Keras,
    Google's TensorFlow, and H2O. Use this guide to uncover the difficulties of pattern
    recognition, scaling data with greater accuracy, and discussing deep-learning
    algorithms and techniques. Whether you want to dive deeper into deep learning
    or want to investigate how to get more out of this powerful technology, you'll
    find everything inside.
