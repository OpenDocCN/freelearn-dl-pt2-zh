- en: On completion of this section, you will have gained experience in how to train
    efficient models for challenging problems such as long-context NLP tasks under
    limited computational capacity, and how to work with multilingual and cross-lingual
    language modeling. You will learn about the tools needed to monitor the inner
    parts of the models for explainability and interpretability and to track your
    model-training performance. You will also be able to serve models in a real production
    environment.
