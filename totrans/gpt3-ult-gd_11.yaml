    on four of the most controversial aspects of GPT-3: AI bias being encoded into

    because people are prepared to interpret it as meaningful. Many also view the

    and demand that they be held accountable for its contents.

- en: The risks we consider in this chapter follow from the nature of GPT-3’s training
    data, which is to say, the English-speaking internet. Human language reflects
    our worldviews, including our biases—and people who have the time and access to
    publish their words online are often in positions of privilege with respect to
    racism, gender, and other forms of oppression, which means they tend to be overrepresented
    in LLM training data. In short, society’s biases and dominant worldviews are already
    encoded in the training data. Without careful fine-tuning (more on this later
    in the chapter), GPT-3 absorbs these biases, problematic associations, and violent
    abuse and includes them in its output for the world to interpret.

    and can be amplified or even radicalized by the GPT-3-generated output. The risk
    is that people read and spread such texts, reinforcing and propagating problematic
    stereotypes and abusive language in the process. Those targeted by the harmful
    messages may experience psychological repercussions. In addition, those wrongly
    perceived to be “authors” of the GPT-3-generated text may face harm to their reputations
    or even attempts at retribution. What’s more, such biases can also emerge in future
    LLMs trained on datasets that include the publicly available output of previous
    generations of LLMs.

- en: Because of these “concerns about large language models being used to generate
    deceptive, biased, or abusive language at scale,” OpenAI initially released an
    abbreviated version of GPT-3’s predecessor, GPT-2, with sample code, but did not
    release its datasets, training code, or model weights. OpenAI has since invested
    heavily in content filtering models and other research aimed at fixing the biases
    in its AI models. A content filtering model is a program fine-tuned to recognize
    potentially offensive language and prevent inappropriate completions. OpenAI provides
    a content filtering engine in its API completion endpoint (discussed in Chapter
    2) to filter unwanted text. When the engine is running, it evaluates the text
    that GPT-3 generates and classifies it as “safe,” “sensitive,” or “unsafe.” (For
    details, see the [OpenAI documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/content-filter).) 
    When you interact with the API via Playground, GPT-3’s content filtering model
    always runs in the background. Figure 6-1 shows an example of the Playground tagging
    potentially offensive content.

    logical to OpenAI to look for solutions in the data itself. As you’ve seen, language
    models can output almost any kind of text, with any kind of tone or personality,
    depending on the user’s input. In a June 2021 study, OpenAI researchers Irene
    Solaiman and Christy Dennison [explain](https://cdn.openai.com/palms.pdf) a process
    they call PALMS, for Process for Adapting Language Models to Society. PALMS is
    a way to improve language model behavior with respect to specific ethical, moral,
    and societal values by fine-tuning models on a curated dataset of fewer than 100
    examples of those values. This process becomes more effective as models get larger.
    Models showed behavioral improvement without compromising their accuracy on downstream
    tasks, suggesting that OpenAI can develop tools to narrow GPT-3’s repertoire of
    behaviors to a constrained set of values.

    he proved his point. Despite the weird writing pattern and a few errors, only
    a small percentage of Hacker News commenters asked if the post might have been
    generated by an algorithm. Those comments were immediately downvoted by other
    community members. For Porr, the most astonishing aspect of his “achievement”

- en: 'In evaluating the environmental impact of LLMs, it’s important to consider
    not only the resources that go into training but also how these resources are
    amortized as the model is used and fine-tuned over its lifetime. Though models
    like GPT-3 consume significant resources during training, they can be surprisingly
    efficient once trained: even with the full GPT-3 175B, generating one hundred
    pages of content from a trained model can cost on the order of 0.4 kW/hr, or only
    a few cents in energy costs. Additionally, because GPT-3 exhibits few-shot generalization,
    it doesn’t need to be retrained for every new task like smaller models do. The
    2019 paper “[Green AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.10597.pdf)” in the journal Communications
    of the ACM notes that “the trend of releasing pre-trained models publicly is a
    green success,” and the authors encourage organizations “to continue to release
    their models in order to save others the costs of retraining them.”'

    Patterson et al. point out, “Remarkably, the choice of DNN, datacenter, and processor
    can reduce the carbon footprint up to ~100-1000X”. Algorithmic techniques can
    also improve energy efficiency. Some work by achieving the same accuracy with
    less overall computation. Other techniques use a large, already-trained model
    as a starting point to yield a lighter-weight, more computationally efficient
    model with almost the same accuracy.

- en: First, ask whether you need to use GPT-3\. Think of the level of sophistication
    required for the task or problem you need to solve. Many tasks are trivial enough
    to be solved with other, more cost-effective, open-source machine-learning models,
    some of which are publicly available. While this might not be as exciting a cocktail-party
    conversation-starter as building an app based on GPT-3, not everything needs to
    be solved by applying the world's largest, most sophisticated language model.
    When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail, right? Well, at least we
    warned you.

    that it was built based on a corpus of text that partially consists of the entire
    internet. So rather than letting it loose in the wild, you would be wise to spend
    some time creating solid content filters.

- en: Once your filters are in place, you may want to spend some time giving your
    GPT-3-powered app  the exact personality and communication style you desire by
    creating a smaller, carefully curated dataset of text samples. This should include
    sensitive topics and an outline of what behaviors you consider desirable from
    the model. Fine-tuning your model on this dataset allows it to adapt to your style
    and to societal norms.

    Instead, release it first in private beta and try it out on some test users. Observe
    how they interact with the model and note whether anything needs to be tweaked
    (which is perfectly normal). So another good practice is to increase your user
    base gradually, so you can improve your app with every iteration.

- en: As they say, with great power comes great responsibility. This rings especially
    true in the context of GPT-3 and LLMs. As we completed this book, in early 2022,
    the world is reeling from a series of environmental disasters, an unprecedented
    pandemic, and war. In these particularly dynamic and fragile times, it is incredibly
    important to ensure that we can trust the companies producing these powerful models
    to have transparent, value-guided leadership.

    or warn you away from working with LLMs, but because ignoring them can have destructive
    consequences. We see this book as a contribution to an important conversation,
    and we hope that the AI community in general, and OpenAI in particular, will continue
    working to address and solve the problems of LLMs and AI.
