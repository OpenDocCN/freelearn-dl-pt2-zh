- en: Penetration testing and red teaming are specialized approaches to cybersecurity
    assessment. Penetration testing, often referred to as *ethical hacking*, involves
    the simulation of cyber-attacks on a system, network, or application to uncover
    vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. Red teaming, on the
    other hand, is a more comprehensive and adversarial engagement that simulates
    a full-scale attack to evaluate an organization’s detection and response capabilities.
    Emulating adversarial tactics using such methods is crucial for evaluating the
    security posture of an organization.

    publicly available. In the realm of cybersecurity, OSINT serves as a valuable
    tool, offering insights into potential vulnerabilities, threats, and targets within
    an organization. Among the myriad sources of OSINT, company job listings stand
    out as a particularly rich trove of data. At first glance, job listings are innocuous,
    aiming to attract potential candidates by detailing the responsibilities, qualifications,
    and benefits associated with a position. However, these descriptions often inadvertently
    disclose far more than intended.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    might reveal the exact technologies a company uses, potentially highlighting known
    vulnerabilities in that software. Similarly, listings that mention proprietary
    technologies or in-house tools can give hints about a company’s unique technological
    landscape. Job ads might also detail team structures, revealing hierarchies and
    key roles, which can be exploited for social engineering attacks. Furthermore,
    geographic locations, departmental interactions, and even the tone of the job
    listing can provide astute observers with insights into a company’s culture, size,
    and operational focus.
