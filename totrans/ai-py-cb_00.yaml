- en: '**Artificial Intelligence** (**AI**) is the field concerned with automating tasks
    in a way that exhibits some form of intelligence to human spectators. This apparent
    intelligence could be similar to human intelligence, or simply some insightful
    action a machine or program surprises us with. Since our understanding of the
    world improves along with our tools, our expectations of what would surprise us
    or strike us as intelligent are continuously being raised. Rodney Brooks, a well-known
    researcher in the field of AI, expressed this effect (often referred to as the **AI
    effect**):'

    that's just a computation." We used to joke that AI means "almost implemented."

- en: AI has made huge strides, especially over the last few years with the arrival
    of powerful hardware, such as **Graphics Processing Units** (**GPUs**) and now **T****ensor
    Processing Units** (**TPUs**), that can facilitate more powerful models, such
    as deep learning models with hundreds of thousands, millions, or even billions of
    parameters. These models perform better and better on benchmarks, often reaching
    human or even super-human levels. Excitingly for anyone involved in the field,
    some of these models, trained for many thousands of hours that would be worth
    hundreds of thousands of dollars if run on **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**),
    are available for download to play with and extend.

- en: This giant leap in performance is especially remarkable in image processing,
    audio processing, and increasingly in natural language processing. Nowhere has
    this been as evident and as showcased in media as it has in games. While the 1997
    chess match between Kasparov and Deep Blue is still in the mind of many people,
    it can be argued that the success of the machine against the human chess champion
    was mostly due to the brute-force searching and analyzing of 200 million positions
    per second on a powerful supercomputer. Since then, however, a combination of
    algorithmic and computational capacities has given machines proficiency and mastery
    in even more complex games.
