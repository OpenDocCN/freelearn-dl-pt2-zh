    vector form. This process is generally termed *vectorization*. While it is a useful
    method, the BoW model has its limitations when it comes to capturing context,
    along with sparsity-related issues. Since deep learning architectures are becoming
    de facto state-of-the-art systems in most spaces, it is obvious that we should
    be leveraging them for NLP tasks as well. Apart from the issues mentioned earlier,
    the sparse and large (wide) vectors from the BoW model are another aspect which
    can be tackled using neural networks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A simple alternative that handles the sparsity issue can be implemented by encoding
    each word as a unique number. Continuing with the example from the previous section,
    "some say ice", we could assign 1 to "some", 2 to "say", 3 to "ice", and so on.
    This would result in a dense vector, [1, 2, 3]. This is an efficient utilization
    of space and we end up with vectors where all the elements are full. However,
    the limitation of missing context still remains. Since the numbers are arbitrary,
    they hardly capture any context on their own. On the contrary, arbitrarily mapping
    numbers to words is not very interpretable.

    For computer vision use cases, visual cues are good enough indicators for understanding
    how a model is perceiving or generating outputs (though quantification is also
    a problem there, but we can skip it for now). For NLP tasks, since the textual
    data is first required to be transformed into a vector, it is important to understand
    what those vectors capture and how they are used by the models.'

    of taking the whole corpus into account in one go, this approach tries to iteratively
    learn to encode each word's representation, along with its context. This idea
    of learning word representations as dense context vectors is not a new one. It
    was first proposed by Rumelhart et al. in 1990Â². They presented how a neural network
    is able to learn representations, with similar words ending up in the same clusters.
    The ability to have vector forms of words that capture some notion of similarity
    is quite a powerful one. Let's see in detail how the word2vec models achieve this.

    along a sentence. The word in the middle is termed the *target*, and the terms
    to its left and right within the window are the *context terms*. The CBOW model

    This assumption is challenged and improved upon in the FastText implementation.
    The word representation aspect of FastText is based on the paper, *Enriching Word
    Vectors with Subword Information* by Bojanowski et al. in 2017.â´ This work decomposes
    each word into a set of n-grams. This helps in capturing and learning vector representations
    of different combinations of characters, as opposed to the whole word in earlier

    it will decompose the word into {<india>, <in, ind, ndi, dia, ia>}. The symbols
    "<" and ">" are special characters to denote the start and end of the original
    word. This helps in differentiating between <in>, which represents the whole word,
    and <in, which is an n-gram. This approach helps FastText generate embeddings
    for *out of vocabulary* terms as well. This can be done by adding and averaging
    the vector representation of required n-grams.

    the input sentence from left to right (right to left for languages that are written
    from right to left). The sliding window depicted in *Figure 9.6* spans three words,
    which act as input. The corresponding output for each training data point is the
    immediate next word after the window (or a set of words if the aim is to predict
    the next phrase). We thus prepare our training dataset, which consists of tuples
    of the form ({context terms}, next_word). The sliding window helps us to generate
    a good number of training samples from every sentence in the training dataset

    and the model generates the corresponding next word. We then make use of **backpropagation

    the model's capacity to learn complex features and even abstract representations

    We have already discussed how LSTMs, and RNNs in general, condition their outputs
    by making use of previous timesteps. When it comes to text or any sequence data,
    this means that the LSTM is able to make use of past context to predict future
    timesteps. While this is a very useful property, this is not the best we can achieve.
    Let''s illustrate why this is a limitation through an example:'

    the target word "Teddy", the model would not pick up the context properly. To
    handle such scenarios, bidirectional LSTMs were introduced. The idea behind them
    is pretty simple and straightforward. A bidirectional LSTM (or biLSTM) is a combination
    of two LSTM layers that work simultaneously. The first is the usual forward LSTM,
    which takes the input sequence in its original order. The second one is called
    the backward LSTM, which takes **a reversed copy** of the sequence as input. The
    following diagram showcases a typical biLSTM setup:'

    to process the original and reversed copy of the input sequences. Since we have
    two LSTM cells working on different contexts at any given time step, we need a
    way of defining the output that will be used by the downstream layers in the network.
    The outputs can be combined via summation, multiplication, concatenation, or even
    averaging of hidden states. Different deep learning frameworks might set different
    defaults, but the most widely used method is concatenation of the biLSTM outputs.
    Please note that, similar to biLSTM, we can make use of bi-RNNs or even bi-GRUs
    (**Gated Recurrent Units**).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The biLSTM setup has advantages compared to a normal LSTM, as the former can
    look at the future context as well. This advantage also becomes a limitation when
    it is not possible to peek into the future. For the current use case of text generation,
    biLSTMs are leveraged in an encoder-decoder type of architecture. We make use
    of biLSTMs to learn better embeddings of the inputs, but the decoding stage (where
    we use these embeddings to guess the next word) only uses the normal LSTMs. Similar
    to earlier hands-on exercises, we can train this network using the same set of
    utilities. We leave this as an exercise for you; for now, we will move on to convolutions.

    and then generate a vector representation of each of these sub-sequences. Though
    such sub-sequences may or may not carry much meaning, they provide us with a way
    to understand words in different contexts, as well as their usage. Since we already
    understand how to prepare dense vector representation of words (see the *Distributed

    for quite some time. While we discussed how CNNs are a good choice for capturing
    the context of a given word, this presents a problem for certain use cases. For
    instance, tasks such as language modeling/text generation require models to understand
    context, but only from one side. In simple words, a language model works by looking
    at words that have already been processed (past context) to generate future words.
