- en: Through exposure to the news and social media, you probably are familiar with
    the fact that machine learning has become one of the most exciting technologies
    of our time and age. Large companies, such as Microsoft, Google, Meta, Apple,
    Amazon, IBM, and many more, heavily invest in machine learning research and applications
    for good reasons. While it may seem that machine learning has become the buzzword
    of our time and age, it is certainly not hype. This exciting field opens the way
    to new possibilities and has become indispensable to our daily lives. Talking
    to the voice assistant on our smartphones, recommending the right product for
    our customers, preventing credit card fraud, filtering out spam from our e-mail
    inboxes, detecting and diagnosing medical diseases, the list goes on and on.

    or even consider a career in machine learning research, then this book is for
    you! However, for a novice, the theoretical concepts behind machine learning can
    be quite overwhelming. Yet, many practical books that have been published in recent
    years will help you get started in machine learning by implementing powerful learning
    algorithms.

- en: Getting exposed to practical code examples and working through example applications
    of machine learning is a great way to dive into this field. Concrete examples
    help to illustrate the broader concepts by putting the learned material directly
    into action. However, remember that with great power comes great responsibility!
    In addition to offering hands-on experience with machine learning using Python
    and Python-based machine learning libraries, this book also introduces the mathematical
    concepts behind machine learning algorithms, which is essential for using machine
    learning successfully. Thus, this book is different from a purely practical book;
    it is a book that discusses the necessary details regarding machine learning concepts,
    offers intuitive yet informative explanations on how machine learning algorithms
    work, how to use them, and most importantly, how to avoid the most common pitfalls.
