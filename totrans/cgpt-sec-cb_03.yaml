    focusing on a key concern in today’s digital world: ensuring the security of your
    software system. With the increasing complexity of technology and ever-evolving
    threats, it has become crucial to adopt a **Secure Software Development Lifecycle**
    (**SSDLC**) that integrates security considerations at each stage. Here, we illustrate
    how the use of AI, specifically the ChatGPT model, can help streamline this process.'

    of the generated output. The function returns the AI-generated content, which

    key obtained from the environment variables.

    These structures are simply arrays containing the titles of sections that will
    make up these final documents.

    uses ChatGPT, prompted with a message tailored to generate content for a specified
    section of the document, given some Python source code. It then returns the generated
    response as a string.

    named `source_code.py` with the help of Python’s built-in `open()` function.

    An instance of the `Document` class is created, and a loop is used to iterate
    over each section title outlined in `design_doc_structure`. In each iteration,
    the loop generates content for the section using the `generate_section_content()`
    function and writes this content to the design document with the help of the `write_to_word_document()`
    function.

    from the `Document` class. As a result, you will receive a design document and
    a user guide, both of which are auto-generated by ChatGPT based on the source
    code provided.
